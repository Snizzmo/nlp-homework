This is all of the major assignments for the natural language processing course I took in university. 
HW 7 shows a basic chatbot. 
HW 8 is a pdf showing a jupyter notebook and step-by-steps reading in data from a csv, vectorizing the data, and making a neural network which identifies who the author is with sklearn and pandas.
