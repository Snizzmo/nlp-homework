 |state=collapsed :  {{National members of the International Fencing Federation|state=collapsed}}  to show the template collapsed, i.e., hidden apart from its title bar 
 |state=expanded :  {{National members of the International Fencing Federation|state=expanded}}  to show the template expanded, i.e., fully visible 
 |state=autocollapse :  {{National members of the International Fencing Federation|state=autocollapse}} 
 
 shows the template collapsed to the title bar if there is a  {{ navbar }} , a  {{ sidebar }} , or some other table on the page with the collapsible attribute 
 shows the template in its expanded state if there are no other collapsible items on the page 
 
 If the  |state=  parameter in the template on this page is not set, the template's initial visibility is taken from the  |default=  parameter in the  Collapsible option  template. For the template on this page, that currently evaluates to  autocollapse .
