 Concept and creation [ change  |  change source ] 
   Mario's symbol 
 Mario first appeared in the arcade game  Donkey Kong  as a  carpenter  named "Jumpman". [3]  In Japan, he was called "Mr. Video". Later, he was named "Mario", after Mario Segale, who was a lot like Mario.  Mario Segale  was the owner of the land where  Nintendo of America 's office was built. [4] 
 Mario later appeared with his younger brother  Luigi  in an arcade game called  Mario Bros.  When the  Nintendo Entertainment System  was out in shops,  Super Mario Bros.  was released for the  Nintendo Entertainment System  the same year as the game console itself, and has often been considered one of the best games on it next to  Super Mario Bros. 3   and  Legend Of Zelda .
 Back then, games were hard to make and Nintendo could not make Mario move without making his arms "disappear". Changing his clothes fixed it. They also did not have the space to give him a mouth or ears, and they could not make hair, so Mario had a moustache, sideburns, and a cap so it would not look like he was bald. Mario's creator,  Shigeru Miyamoto , said that he gave Mario a cap because he has a hard time drawing hair. [5]  Mario is currently voiced by  Charles Martinet , who also voices  Luigi ,  Wario  and  Waluigi , respectively, and other characters like  Toadsworth . [6] 
 Mario is Nintendo's mascot (the face of the company). Mario's  rival  was  Sega 's mascot,  Sonic the Hedgehog , who was first seen in 1991. The two mascots were trying to get more people to buy their games for years until 2001 when  Sonic Adventure 2: Battle  was released on a Nintendo machine since Sega games started to be released on game machines that were not made by Sega. [7]  Mario and Sonic appeared together in a sports game,  Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games , and again in  Super Smash Bros. Brawl  as well as  Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U . To this day, Mario and Sonic continue to appear together in Nintendoâs spinoff titles such as  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate .

 Appearances [ change  |  change source ] 
 Mario was first seen as "Jumpman" in  Donkey Kong  in 1981. He was first named "Mario" in the arcade game  Donkey Kong Junior  in 1982, the only game where he is a villain. His twin brother  Luigi  was first seen in 1983 in  Mario Bros.  He was next seen in  Super Mario Bros.  for the  Nintendo Entertainment System  (NES), which would quickly be one of the most famous games on the console.
 By 2007, more than 200 million copies of Mario games had been sold all over the world. [8]  The game that was best sold was  Super Mario Bros. 3 . [9]  Mario was also seen in some  Game & Watch  games. Mario has appeared in almost every type of video game, like  platform ,  puzzle ,  racing ,  sports ,  fighting ,  role-playing  and  educational  games.
 Mario has been seen in many games, and is seen in games that are not Mario games as well, like  Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!  where he is a  referee . He is also a character you can play as in the  Super Smash Bros.  series . Mario has even appeared as a secret character which any player can play as in  GameCube  version of  NBA Street V3  and  SSX on Tour , which are both from  Electronic Arts . In some games, he only makes very small appearances: in both  The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past  and  The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time , a picture of Mario can be seen, and in  Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes  small Mario and  Yoshi  statues can be seen.
 After the Game & Watch game  Mario Bombs Away , the first  Mario  non-platformer game,  Dr. Mario , was sold in 1990. There are two educational  Mario  games that have been made. They are called  Mario Paint , was sold in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and  Mario Pinball Land  for the Game Boy Advance. 1996's  Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars  for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System is the first  Mario  role-playing game. There have also been five more Mario RPG's:  Paper Mario , for the Nintendo 64;  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga , for the Game Boy Advance;  Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door , for the Nintendo GameCube;  Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time , for the Nintendo DS and  Super Paper Mario , for the Wii. Now, there is a new RPG game that came out called  Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  for the Nintendo DS.
 There have been more series based on the original  Mario  series. The  Mario Kart  series' first game was  Super Mario Kart  for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The  Mario Kart  series is the most successful racing video game series of all time. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  The  Mario Kart  series is a type of  Mario  sports game. There have been other  Mario  sports games like  Mario Golf  and  Mario Tennis , and the baseball and soccer games  Mario Superstar Baseball  and  Super Mario Strikers . In 1999, the  Mario Party  series started on the  Nintendo 64 . In the  Mario Party  games, players have to play-through a lot of mini-games.
 There has been a few TV shows and a movie for the  Mario  series. The name of the first TV show is  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  and the movie is called  Super Mario Bros. . The TV show starred  "Captain" Lou Albano  as Mario, and the movie starred  Bob Hoskins  as Mario. There have also been  Mario  toys sold in some places.
 
 
 Characteristics [ change  |  change source ] 
 Mario was first a  2D  character but since technology has changed, Nintendo has remade Mario in  3D . He is a plumber who lives in the land of  Mushroom Kingdom . He is the older, shorter brother of  Luigi , and they are both plumbers. In the television series, Mario and Luigi are from  Brooklyn , although  Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island  says he was born in the Mushroom Kingdom.
 
 Physical appearance [ change  |  change source ] 
 Mario's looks have changed over the years although he has several  staple  features. He is a short, stubby man wearing a hat with an "M" on it, brown hair, black  moustache , a very large nose, white gloves, and  denim   overalls . In most appearances, Mario wears a red hat and shirt with blue overalls. However, in the original  Super Mario Bros.  video game, Mario wears a brown shirt and red overalls.
 Mario's clothes depend on the game he is in. For example, in the  Super Mario Strikers   soccer  game, Mario wears a  football kit  instead of overalls, and in  Super Mario Sunshine ,  a very sunshiny tropical game, the character wears a red T-shirt and can also put on sunglasses and a Hawaiian-style shirt. In some games, Mario can turn into different forms, each with different clothes.
 
 Personality [ change  |  change source ] 
 Mario is a kind-hearted and brave hero, with a love of  pasta  and  pizza . People know Mario has a great, happy, personality since he has a high pitched, funny voice. Since  Mario's Game Gallery ,  Charles Martinet  has been his voice actor. [15]  In the games, Mario speaks in English with a thick Italian  accent . In other things like TV shows, he has a more Brooklyn-styled accent. Mario does not say many things. He usually says: "Okey dokey!", "Woohoo!", "Let's a-go!", "It's-a me! Mario!", "'ere we go", "Mama mia!" and more, though in  sports  games, he says things relevant to the sport, in Mario Golf he says "Fore!" for example. Mario hardly ever speaks properly in any games, leaving the talking to other characters. He does speak normally in the DiC animated cartoons and the anime series.
 
 Occupation and hobbies [ change  |  change source ] 
 Mario is a plumber (he was a carpenter). He only acts like a plumber in the games,  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga  and the original  Mario Bros. , but pipes are always one way to get around. Mario was seen plumbing during the animated series. He knows a lot about tools and fixing pipes in the movie. In the first Donkey Kong games when Mario was called Jumpman, he was a carpenter. [16] 
 In the  Dr. Mario  games first seen in 1990, Mario is a doctor. In 2001, Mario appeared in  Dr. Mario 64 , an updated version of the original puzzle game. Dr. Mario appeared as an secret character in the  Nintendo GameCube  game  Super Smash Bros. Melee , and in another newer version,  Dr. Mario Virus Buster , for  WiiWare . In the  Game Boy  game  Mario's Picross , Mario is an  archaeologist .
 Mario usually saves  Princess Peach  (AKA Princess Toadstool),  Princess Daisy  and  Pauline . And he usually has to defeat villains, like  Bowser (AKA King Koopa in Japan) Most characters in the games know who he is because he acts like a hero, as shown in  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga , where they are called "superstars", or celebrities. [17] 
 In  Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis , it is said that Mario has a toy-making company that earns him money.
 
 Relationships [ change  |  change source ] 
 Since his first game, Mario has to save the " damsel in distress " of the game. Originally, he had to rescue his girlfriend  Pauline  in  Donkey Kong . Pauline was soon replaced by a new damsel-in-distress,  Princess Peach , in  Super Mario Bros.  (she was first named "Princess Toadstool" or simply "the Princess" in English-speaking places until 1993, when  Yoshi's Safari  was sold, even though the name was not widely used until  Super Mario 64  was sold three years later). [18]  Pauline returned in the  Game Boy  remake of  Donkey Kong  in 1994, and later  Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis  in 2006, although the character is now said to be "Mario's friend". [19] 
 Mario has rescued Princess Peach lots of times since  Super Mario Bros. . In a  role reversal , Peach rescues Mario in  Super Princess Peach . Some people say the two could be a couple. [20] [21] 
 Luigi  is Mario's younger brother. He is usually a companion on many of Mario's adventures and the character whom players play as in two-player sessions of many of the video games. His demeanor is sometimes that of a "scaredy cat" who sets off to help Mario but instead needs rescuing himself, though he has also had to rescue Mario occasionally as displayed in  Mario is Missing!  and  Luigi's Mansion .  Yoshi  is another one of Mario's friends.
 Mario rescued  Princess Daisy  in  Super Mario Land  for the  Game Boy . In  Super Smash Bros. Melee , the text explaining Princess Daisy's trophy states that "after her appearance in Mario Golf, some gossips portrayed her as Luigi's answer to Mario's Peach", [22]  although Luigi and Daisy were previously paired as a romantic couple in the live-action  Super Mario Bros  movie.
 Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins  for the Game Boy saw the arrival of  Wario , Mario's  counterpart . Though there is no clear relationship between the two, Wario was once referred to as Mario's cousin in  Nintendo Power . Wario is designed to act, in a way, as an anti-Mario. [23] 
 
 Baby Mario [ change  |  change source ] 
 Baby Mario is Mario when he was a child. He first appeared in  Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island , released in 1995 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and has appeared in several titles since. Baby Mario has often appeared in Nintendo-sports titles, such as  Mario Golf ,  Mario Tennis ,  Mario Superstar Baseball ,  Mario Kart: Double Dash!! ,  Mario Super Sluggers , and  Mario Kart Wii . These games imply Mario and Baby Mario are separate characters, but those games are considered to be outside the  continuity  of the main  Mario  series. More recently, he has appeared in  Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time , in which Baby Mario appeared via time travel along with Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, and Baby Bowser, which could explain the separation of the two characters. Like the older Mario, Baby Mario is voiced by  Charles Martinet . [24] 
 
 Abilities [ change  |  change source ] 
 During the development of  Donkey Kong , Mario was known as "Jumpman". Jumpingâboth to access places and as an offensive moveâis a common gameplay element in  Mario  games, especially the  Super Mario Bros.  series.
 Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in  Mario Bros. . This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes also causing secondary effects. This attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like  Koopa Troopas  into their shells, which can slide into and damage other enemies or Mario.
 Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities.  Super Mario World  added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. Later, the Game Boy version of  Donkey Kong  allows Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In  Super Mario 64 , Mario has several jumping abilities, such as a sideways somersault, a "ground pound", which makes Mario hit the ground under him hard, and the "Wall Kick", which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.
 
 Power-ups [ change  |  change source ] 
 Mario uses many items, which give him various powers. The one that shows up the most often is the "Super Mushroom", which allows Mario to grow to twice his size, becoming "Super Mario" (after the name of the series), and can take a hit before shrinking back down to "regular" Mario. If "Super Mario" collects a "Fire Flower", he will transform into "Fire Mario", who can throw fireballs at enemies. Picking up a "Star" makes it so nothing can hurt Mario for several seconds.
 A common theme in the  Mario  series' power-ups is the fact that many items give Mario a semi-animal appearance, sometimes related to the item itself, for example  Super Mario Bros. 3 ' s Frog Suit, which turns Mario into a frog, and  Super Mario Land 2 ' s Power Carrot, which transforms Mario into a rabbit. Other times the item may not be related to the power; for example, the Raccoon Leaf gives him raccoon ears, a tail, and the power of flight. Other power-ups are overall more useful; in  Super Mario World , the Cape allows Mario to fly and glide, and a balloon in a later game in the series allows similar effects.  New Super Mario Bros.  introduced other types of Mushroom power-ups, such as the "Mega Mushroom", which causes Mario to grow to a screen-filling size and the "Mini Mushroom" that makes him shrink to a very small size.
 When Mario reached the three dimensional format,  Super Mario 64  introduced a feature that made Mario take extra damage without his signature hat on; in addition to this, different types of caps gave him powers of flight, invincibility, and invisibility. Along with these basic features, caps gave more practical abilities as well. For example, the Metal cap allowed Mario to sink to sea floors and the Invisibility cap allowed him to walk through thin surfaces such as iron grates.
 Super Mario Sunshine  has several few power-ups with a water theme. He is granted a F.L.U.D.D. ( F lash  L iquidizing  U ltra  D ousing  D evice) pack that performs his main attack and squirts paint and enemies with water, named the Squirt Nozzle. He has three other expansion packs including the Hover Nozzle, which allows him to hover for short distances, the Turbo Nozzle, which allows him to move a lot faster and break through some barriers, and the Rocket Nozzle, which charges water up, then blasts Mario high into the air.
 Super Mario Galaxy  introduced several new power-ups along with a few older items re-done. These include the Bee Shroom, which allows him to float short distances and stick to certain surfaces; the Boo Shroom, which makes him capable of floating as well as traveling through walls; the Life Shroom, which gives him three more life wedges; the Rainbow Star, granting him brief invincibility; the Fire Flower, which appeared for the first time in a 3D game; and the Ice Flower, which allows him to turn water into solid ice so he can go to otherwise unreachable or deadly places. A hidden power-up is the Flight Star, which allows Mario to fly for a while.
 Mario uses hammers in numerous games, such as  Super Mario Bros. 3 , the original  Donkey Kong , and  Super Mario RPG . Hammers are used to attack and for other things, like flicking switches and solving puzzles. He often picks up and throws various projectiles around him, however, starting in  Super Mario Bros. 2 . He tosses items such as vegetables, giant blocks and  Bob-ombs .
 In the  Mario Kart  series, there are a number of  items  to use. For example, a  mushroom  makes the characters go faster for 1  second .

 As Nintendo's  mascot , many people think that Mario is the most famous video game character of all time. [3] [5]  The  Mario  series of  video games  has sold more than 200 million copies, making it the best selling game series of all time. [25]   Mario was the first video game character to get a wax figure in the  Hollywood Wax Museum  in 2003. In 1990, a national  survey  showed that more kids knew Mario than  Mickey Mouse . [26] 
 Since he was created, Mario has become a very famous person having been in many television shows, comic books, and in a movie. He has been on lunch boxes, T-shirts, magazines, commercials, in candy form, on Shampoo bottles, cereal, badges, and as a stuffed toy. [27]  Nintendo of Japan made a 60-minute  anime  (Japanese cartoon) movie starring Mario and his friends in 1986, but this movie has never been shown or sold on DVD outside of Japan. The animated series  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  had a live-action series of episodes starring former WWF manager  "Captain" Lou Albano  as Mario and  Danny Wells  as Luigi. There was even a book series, the  Nintendo Adventure Books . In 2005, Jonathan Mann even wrote an  opera  based on the character, and performed  The Mario Opera  at the  California Institute of the Arts .
 Bergsala , the  distributor  of Nintendo's products in the  Nordic  and the  Baltic countries , is located at Marios Gata 21 (Mario's Street 21) in  Kungsbacka ,  Sweden , named after Mario. [28] 
 Mario's legacy is  recognized  by Guinness World Records, who awarded the Nintendo Mascot and his games seven records in the  Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008 . These records include, "Best Selling Video Game Series of All Time", "First Movie Based on an Existing Video Game", and "Most Prolific Video Game Character", with Mario appearing in 116 distinct titles (not including remakes or re-releases).
 In a poll conducted in 2008, Mario was voted as the most popular video game character in Japan.
 
 In popular culture [ change  |  change source ]
