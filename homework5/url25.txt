 J apan's prime minister Shinzo Abe made an appearance during the Closing Ceremony of the Rio Olympics, disguised as Super Mario. 
 As the Closing Ceremony drew to a close , theÂ governor of Tokyo formally accepted the Olympic flag, marking the end of the 2016 games. 
 As per tradition, the next hosts were afforded a short time to showcase their country and give a teaser trailer of their plans for the next Games.

 T here's widespread expectation that the games in Tokyo , one of the world's richest, most recognisable, cosmopolitan cities, will run more smoothly than they have in Rio.
