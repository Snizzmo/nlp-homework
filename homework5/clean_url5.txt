Forbidden A Short History of Fencing Fencing is probably one of the oldest games in existence, for it sprangdirectly from the duel, and the latter has been extant as long as there hasbeen war.In the old days there were duels between two persons, and oftenbetween two whole armies, depending on the conditions of war.The Germanictribes which swarmed over the Empire at the fall of Rome were perhaps theearliest people to recognize combat with swords as a means of settlingquestions of justice or of vindicating a grievance.Under the Germanic influence the duel spread all over Christendom.Even asearly as the reign of Charlemagne it was admitted as material proof in thejudgments of God.This practice continued throughout the Middle Ages, as anintegral part of chivalry.It was under the rule of their Catholic Majesties of Spain that the duelfirst came under official ban, by the law of the city of Toledo in 1480.Curiously enough, it is shortly before this time that we find the first bookon fencing, Treatise on Arms, by Diego de Valera, which was written between1458 and 1471, and which marks the birth of fencing as a scientific art.Some time later, when Spain became the leading power of Europe, the Spanisharmies carried fencing abroad and particularly into the south of Italy, thenone of the main battlefields of the nations.By that time fencing had alsodeveloped in the north of Italy where it was taught in the universities sideby side with law, in such cultural centres as Bologna and Venice, which werethen attracting students from every country in Europe.If scientific fencing started first in Spain it was in Italy that we findthe first great schools where a fencing tradition was soon establishedthrough the lessons and the writings of many famous master.The weapons were at first used chiefly for offensive purposed, blows beingavoided by body shifts; later the defense was entrusted to some implementcarried by the left arm, a shield, a dagger, or a cloak.As fencing gained in subtlety and efficiency the weapons became lighter andthis developed the use of the sword for parrying to the exclusion ofanything else.The Italians preserved in their swords the old cross-bar ofthe Middle Ages, cutting of the edges so that the bar would not protrudeover the circular guard.The French, on the other hand, eliminated thecross-bar entirely, thus losing some of the strength of the weapon butadding to the ease of its handling.During these changes the old Spanishswords, which were gradual modification of the chivalric weapons, passedinto the museums, as the armies of Europe came to employ the sabre' andlater the modern firearm.It was not until 1900 that Spain, the mother of scientific fencing, came tohave a distinct school of her own, under the Spanish master, Don AdelardoSanz.The Spanish weapon is a modified form of the Italian cross-bar, soshaped as to facilitate the action of the thumb and index finger in securingthe dexterity of the French weapon while preserving the strength of theItalian sword.In some parts of Europe it is called the Portuguese foil.These three schools of fencing which today differ little except insofar asthe peculiarities of each type of weapon demand, dominate fencing all overthe world.The Italian school predominates in Italy, Hungary, Austria,South America and Germany.The French school predominates in France, England, the United States, andCentral America.The Spanish school predominates in Spain and Portugal.Each has had its share of great fencing masters: men like Greco, Pini,Pessina, and Nadi, in Italy; Kirchoffer, Merignac, Rue, and Gaudin inFrance; Sanz and Carbonel in Spain.Italian fencing at the end of the seventeenth century divided into twoseparate schools, the Bolognese or Italian proper, and the Neapolitan;rivalries between the two schools and the general backwardness of thecentury brought indifference towards fencing, and a revival occurred only atthe time of the Napoleonic wars when the enthusiasm for everything militarygave rebirth to fencing.For a while the French school predominated until a revival of the nationalspirit brought back the principles of the old Italian schools which foundnew followers and supporter: finally, a so-called mixed school, embodyingthe best principles of the Italian and French schools, was generally adopted.The chief contribution of the French to this mixed school was to make thedisengage a continuous movement, simultaneous with the lunge.The classicalItalian school had made the feint of a disengage and the following lungedistinct movements, and this change revolutionized fencing in Italy.In 1861 with the founding of the Accademia Nazionale d'Scherme, Naples,became the centre of fencing but it was soon overcome in importance by othercentres, such as Milan, Leghorn, and Rome.The rivalry between the northand south still persisted for a while but, at present, the differences inthe teachings of the various masters in Italy are only variations of aunified system.History in The United States and South America Fencing begins to appear as a popular sport on this side of the Atlanticonly recently, that is since 1900.Under the leadership of the greatItalian master Eugene Pini in the Argentine, and under the French master,Lucien Merignac, in Mexico and some Spanish masters in Cuba, these countriesmade considerable progress at the turn of the century.taken from "The Theory and Practice of Fencing" by Julio MartinexCastello 1933 <a href="mailto:fencing@hcs.harvard.edu>fencing@hcs.harvard.edu
