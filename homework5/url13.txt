  This category contains general information on western Olympic, Classical, and, less frequently, Historical fencing. Each of these versions of fencing involves individual vs. individual competition using some European version of a sword.
 
 Olympic fencing enthusiasts practice the modern version of the sport, utilizing electronic scoring equipment.  The majority of sites in this category are dedicated to Olympic-style fencing. 
 Classical enthusiasts do not utilize electronic scoring and practice and compete emphasizing the nobility of the sport. 
 Historical fencing typically utilizes multiple weapons at once, and practices the sport prior to the days of directed (refereed) bouts.  
        Eastern fencing martial arts sites are listed in the  Sports/Martial Arts  category.
