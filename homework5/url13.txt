Home Latest Video The Bests Highlight Reel Reviews Impressions Cosplay Mario Is Officially A Plumber Again Jason Schreier 3/06/18 10:04AM â¢ Filed to: mario mario plumber super mario kotakucore nintendo 62 14 In September, Nintendo crushed hearts across the world by declaring that Mario was  no longer a plumber . This week, the publisher has remedied that horrible mistake, changing Marioâs bio to note that he is, in fact, a plumber. Advertisement Previously, as translated by  Kotaku âs Brian Ashcraft, the official Japanese Mario bio had read: âAll around sporty, whether itâs tennis or baseball, soccer or car racing, he [Mario] does everything cool. As a matter of fact, he also seems to have worked as a plumber a long time ago.â This week, though, fans on the Nintendo subreddit noticed that  the bio has changed . Now, as translated by  Kotaku âs Tim Rogers (brackets his), it reads: Has a sunny disposition; is popular with everyone. He gets along super-well with his younger twin brother Luigi. Theyâre a famous combo. Has a universal knack for sportsâfrom tennis to baseball, from soccer to car racing, he can do it all and look cool doing it. His occupation is plumber. However, his activities donât stop there. He loves Princess Peach. If she is ever in trouble, he will go to help her no matter what [he will drop whatever he is doing if she needs help; literally âno matter what time it is, he will go to help herâ]. With his specialty jump and various power-ups, he opposes the mischief-making Koopa [Bowser]. Advertisement Finally, our long international nightmare is over. Mario is a plumber again. May the Year of Luigi continue forever. Jason Schreier Posts Email Twitter News editor. Author of  Blood, Sweat, and Pixels .
