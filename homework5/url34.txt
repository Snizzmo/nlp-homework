 “It's-a me, Mario!” 
 — Mario ,  Super Mario 64 
 Mario  is the main character and protagonist of the long-running and highly successful  Mario  franchise . He was created by Japanese video game designer  Shigeru Miyamoto  and serves as the main mascot of  Nintendo . Mario made his first appearance as the protagonist of the arcade game  Donkey Kong , released in  1981  (in which he took the alias " Jumpman "). Since  Super Mario Bros. , his trademark abilities have been his  jumping  and  stomping  powers, with which he defeats most of his enemies, and his ability to gain even more powers with a plethora of items, such as the  Super Mushroom , the  Fire Flower , and the  Super Star . Games have usually portrayed Mario as a silent character without a distinct personality ( Fortune Street  is a notable exception). According to Nintendo's philosophy, this allows Mario to fit in many different genres and roles. In most games, he is the hero that goes on an adventure to save  Princess Peach  from his archenemy,  Bowser , but he has been shown doing many other activities besides adventuring, such as racing and sporting with his  younger twin brother  and others. Mario's main traits are his red hat, thick mustache, Italian accent, cheerful personality, heavy use of power-ups, and high jumping ability.

 Creation 
   Concept art for Mario 
 Following the failure of  Radar Scope  in North America, Nintendo's then-president,  Hiroshi Yamauchi , requested Miyamoto's aid in converting unsold  Radar Scope  units into something that would sell well. Miyamoto conceived the concept of a love triangle and decided to make a game based on  Popeye . He, however, was denied the rights for the  Popeye  franchise, so he decided to come up with a new idea using his own characters.
 For use in his arcade game  Donkey Kong , he created a player character originally known during development as  Ossan  (the Japanese term for "middle-aged man"), then Jumpman and  Mr. Video Game  or  Mr. Video . [2] [3]  Coincidentally, "Ossan" would be the name given to a Mario look-alike in the game  Golf . This character was given red overalls and a blue shirt in order to make the arms more visible as well as a cap and moustache, as hair and a mouth were impossible to animate on the arcade system. [4]  The character was originally known as Jumpman, but Nintendo of Japan asked Nintendo of America if they wanted to rename him during the Western localization; president  Minoru Arakawa  and employee  Don James  thought it would be funny to call the character Mario after the suspenders-wearing Italian American landlord of storage and company housing,  Mario Segale . [5] [6] [7] [ dead link ] [8] [9] [10] [11]  While Mario was initially described as a carpenter,  Mario Bros.  subsequently changed his occupation after a colleague thought that he looked more like a plumber. [12] 
 
 
 History 
 Background 
   Baby Mario is discovered by the tribe of Yoshis. 
   Baby Mario 
 Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island  depicts Mario's beginnings by delivery of a  stork  at nearly the same time as Luigi, suggesting a twin birth. Mario, however, receives help from  Yoshis  shortly after Luigi has been kidnapped by  Kamek , pointing them to Luigi's location. While Mario can still use a power-up,  Superstar Mario , the Yoshis must otherwise protect and guide him to Bowser's Castle. Once Mario and Luigi are rescued, the stork delivers them to their parents.  Yoshi's New Island , however, states they are the wrong parents. After Luigi is kidnapped a few more times, Mario and Luigi reunite with their true parents in  Yoshi's New Island  and  Yoshi's Island DS .
 Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island  is usually considered as one of the first media chronologically in Mario's history, but a few other sources, usually older than  Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island , depict different beginnings. In  Super Mario MomotarÅ , for instance, two elderly  Hammer Brothers  have found and raised Mario, who emerged out of a peach that has fallen from the sky. Mario here resembles his older self, although smaller and without a cap. The story in  Super Mario MomotarÅ , however, is a retelling of a popular Japanese fairy tale and may have no actual bearing on Mario's history. The  Nintendo Comics System  comic entitled " Family Album "The Early Years" " is another early medium that depicts Mario's childhood. According to it, Mario has taken an early interest in plumbing, although frequently misbehaving, such as making his father's pipe emit bubbles instead of smoke. Mario is also adept at sports, scoring home runs in his neighborhood softball team. Mario at birth is shown to have full hair on the head and facial stubble that quickly became a mustache. The comic also implies that Luigi was born several years after Mario, whereas he is depicted as Mario's younger twin in the video games.
 In  Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time , Mario's infant self and adult self unite to defeat the  Shroobs  and save  Princess Peach , although the game takes place from Mario's adult self's setting by labeling his time period as the present and his baby self's time period as the past.

 In  Donkey Kong , Mario is a carpenter who needs to rescue his girlfriend, Lady (later renamed  Pauline ), from  Donkey Kong  at a  construction site . Mario can  jump  over obstacles such as the  barrels  Donkey Kong throws, or Mario can use  hammers  to destroy the barrels and defeat other enemies. After defeating Donkey Kong in the  final level , Mario is reunited with Lady.

 In  Donkey Kong Jr. , Mario appears as the antagonist, having captured Donkey Kong and holding him in a cage, with the protagonist of the game being Donkey Kong's son,  Donkey Kong Jr.  As Donkey Kong Jr. moves through the levels, Mario sends out enemies like  Snapjaws  and other obstacles to stop him. After Donkey Kong Jr. rescues Donkey Kong in the final level, Mario falls and is defeated. In the Arcade version, Mario regains consciousness, and attempts to pursue the pair, only to be sent running away by a kick by the elder Donkey Kong.
 During the intro to the arcade version of the game, there are two Marios that are seen carrying Donkey Kong away.
 
 
 Donkey Kong II 
 Since  Donkey Kong II  serves as a semi-sequel to  Donkey Kong Jr. , Mario reprises his role as the antagonist.
 
 Donkey Kong Circus 
 Mario appears as the antagonist in  Donkey Kong Circus . Mario is an audience member who laughs at Donkey Kong, the new attraction of the circus, whenever he drops a  pineapple  or gets hit by fire. In the end of the game, Mario is shown in the construction site where the first game begins.
 
 Donkey Kong Hockey 
 Mario appears in the game  Donkey Kong Hockey  as the protagonist. His hockey shot is less powerful than Donkey Kong's, but it has more range. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Donkey Kong  (Game Boy) 
   Ending credits of the game, where Mario poses with Pauline, Donkey Kong, and Donkey Kong Jr. at Rocky-Valley 
 Mario makes a later appearance in the  Donkey Kong  series with his updated  Super Mario Bros.  design in  Donkey Kong  on the  Game Boy . Along with the original four  Donkey Kong  levels, Mario has to travel through an additional nine worlds to rescue Pauline. Mario can also perform additional acrobatic maneuvers that can assist him in navigating through levels.
 
   Mario in  Donkey Kong  (Game Boy) 
 Mario can perform a  handstand  move, which protects him from any objects falling on him from above. From the handstand position, Mario can also perform the Handstand Jump. The game also features the  backflip  as well as  wires  on which Mario can  wire-spin  and jump to catapult himself high in the air. Another essential part of Mario's moveset, taken from  Super Mario Bros. 2 , is his ability to pick up enemies and objects and lift them over his head to throw them. This is also one of the few  Mario  games in which Mario takes damage and can lose a life from a high fall.
 In most stages, Mario has to find the  key  and take it to the locked door in order to proceed to the next level. As long as Mario holds the key, he has an additional hit point, although he loses the key when he takes damage. He uses  hammers  as seen in the original  Donkey Kong  and constructs temporary  ladders  and  roads  in order to pass through the levels. Other levels are boss fights against Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong. In the final level, Mario must navigate through the level while chasing Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. to the top of the tower, where he eventually traps Donkey Kong Jr. in a cage, defeats a giant Donkey Kong, and rescues Pauline. In the game's credits, however, Mario seems to have reconciled with Donkey Kong since they are shown together with Donkey Kong Jr. and Pauline in a photo in  Rocky-Valley .
 The ending of the game shows Mario holding Donkey Kong above his head (with Donkey Kong yelling, "HELP!") as  Donkey Kong Jr.  is standing to the left of him. To the right is what appears to be the start of  World 1-1  from  Super Mario Bros.  This foreshadows the events of both  Donkey Kong Jr.  and  Super Mario Bros. 
 Many of Mario's moves and objectives are carried over to the semi-sequel,  Mario vs. Donkey Kong .
 
 Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest 
   Mario's cameo in  Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest 
 Mario makes a cameo appearance in  Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest . He appears at the end of the game as one of  Cranky's Video Game Heroes , along with  Diddy Kong ,  Link , and  Yoshi . With 39  DK Coins  in the original and 67 in the Game Boy Advance version, Mario is the top video game hero.
 
 Donkey Kong 64 
 In  Donkey Kong 64 , specifically in a port of the original  Donkey Kong  game, playable via an arcade set up in  Frantic Factory , Mario re-enacts his initial role. Mario has to go through the same construction site as in the original game, while the old  Donkey Kong  creates mischief down Mario's path. However, a slight modification has been brought to this port, which is related to the game's objective. In the first run, Mario has to rescue  Pauline  from Donkey Kong; however, after she is rescued and the player restarts, Mario can instead collect a special  Nintendo Coin  at the end.
 
 
 Saturday Supercade 
 
 It has been requested that this section be  rewritten  and  expanded  to center information on Mario.
 
 
 Mario appears in several episodes in  Saturday Supercade , which was his first television show. His personality on the show was of a heroic person whose goal was to capture  Donkey Kong .
 
 "The Great Ape Escape" 
 In " The Great Ape Escape ," Donkey Kong escapes by riding a motorcycle, after which Mario and Pauline drive their circus van to chase him. Mario attempts to catch Donkey Kong by disguising himself as a banana and catapulting himself. He tries using sleeping gas on Donkey Kong, but Donkey Kong deflects it and escapes into a nearby prison. In the prison, the  criminals  join with Donkey Kong and exploit his gullibility by having him perform crimes, including theft. Meanwhile, riding on a hot air balloon, Mario and Pauline attempt to lure Donkey Kong with a rope ladder made of bananas. Donkey Kong, however, pops the balloon, so the two then disguise themselves as chefs, but this also fails. During the prison football game, Mario again tries and fails to capture Donkey Kong while disguising himself as a referee. When Donkey Kong and the criminals are finally cornered at the top of the building, Mario, in a police outfit, and Pauline tell Donkey Kong that the criminals are tricking him. Donkey Kong then tosses the criminals in the cage and escapes in a hot air football, leading Mario and Pauline to continue chasing him.
 
 "Greenhouse Gorilla" 
 In " Greenhouse Gorilla ," Donkey Kong is tricked by  Mr. X  to steal  Stanley 's metal-eating plant,  Herman . While chasing Donkey Kong, Stanley meets Mario and Pauline, where they team up to find Donkey Kong and Mr. X. They find Donkey Kong and Mr. X with the plant in the grocery store, but when Mario tries to capture Donkey Kong with his vacuum trap, the plant consumes it and the three escape. Mr. X then leads Donkey Kong to a banquet, where Mario, Pauline, and Stanley are found disguised as hired help. Pauline convinces Donkey Kong to distrust Mr. X, so Mr. X's plan fails and Donkey Kong then escapes, once again leading the three to chase him.
 
 Game & Watch series 
   Mario and other  Mario  characters from  Game & Watch Gallery 2 
 Mario has appeared in several  Game & Watch  games, including  Mario's Bombs Away ,  Mario's Cement Factory ,  Mario the Juggler , and  Super Mario Bros.  He also appeared in four installments of remakes marketed as the  Game & Watch Gallery  series , and he later appeared in  Game & Watch Collection .
 In the Game & Watch version of  Donkey Kong , the objective is the same as in the arcade version, but Mario must trigger a lever, which causes a hook to appear. If Mario grabs the hook, a peg is removed and he is transported to the starting point. If Mario misses, he falls and loses a life. If Mario removes all the pegs, he defeats Donkey Kong.
 In  Mario Bros.  (which is unrelated to the  arcade game of the same name ), Mario and the newly introduced  Luigi  must cooperate and put pallets of bottles on a delivery truck. They have to use conveyor belts to send the package to each other. If they drop a pallet, their boss yells at them. If they drop three pallets, the game is over. In  Game & Watch Gallery 3  and in  Game & Watch Gallery 4 ,  Wario  is the boss and  Bowser  periodically reverses the conveyor belt directions.  Cakes  replace pallets in the game.
 Mario is featured in  Mario the Juggler , a Game & Watch game based on the very first one,  Ball .
 Mario must safely deliver  bombs  in  Mario's Bombs Away , avoiding oil spills and torches.
 
   The Modern version of  Fire  from  Game & Watch Gallery 4 
 In  Mario's Cement Factory , Mario must move cement from hoppers into cement trucks by putting them on conveyor belts. The conveyor belts can hold only three hoppers. If the hopper overflows, some cement can land on a worker, making Mario lose a life. Mario can move by using an elevator, but if he moves when the elevator is not there, he falls and loses a life. If Mario stays in the elevator for too long, he can be crushed or can touch the very bottom, losing a life either way; there are safe zones to circumvent this. In the remake in  Game & Watch Gallery 4 ,  Yoshi  and  Toad  appear as background characters. A  Boo  can appear and interfere with the work. Mario can fall from the elevator, but when he touches the bottom ground, he gets a miss.
 Super Mario Bros.  for the Game & Watch plays similarly to the original game for the NES. This version, however, is simpler and shorter.
 Mario has also appeared in various heavily toned-down games on the Game Watch, a wristwatch that can tell time and play games. The games are based on  Super Mario Bros. ,  Super Mario Bros. 2 ,  Super Mario Bros. 3 ,  Super Mario World ,  Super Mario Kart , and  Donkey Kong .
 In the Modern games of  Game & Watch Gallery  remakes, Mario also takes some roles previously taken by other characters. Other times, he is a non-playable character. In  Fire , for instance, he and Luigi rescue Toads, Yoshis, and Donkey Kong Jrs. from a fire. In another example, in  Chef , Peach must cooperate with Mario and Luigi to feed Yoshi. Mario and Luigi throw the food, and Peach can catch them in her pan.

 Mario as he appears in various different versions of  Mario Bros. 
 
 
 After  Donkey Kong , Mario is given his own starring series, beginning with the arcade game  Mario Bros.  in 1983. Only Mario's physical appearance is taken from earlier titles; Mario is now a plumber working in the sewers of  New York  and fighting an endless number of creatures, such as  Shellcreepers  and  Sidesteppers . Unlike in later games, Mario can't jump on enemies. Instead, he must jump against the ceiling of a platform from below to stun all enemies walking on top of it. When Mario approaches the stunned enemies, he kicks them out of the screen, rendering them defeated. In the two-player mode, the second player plays as  Luigi , here portrayed as a green palette swap of Mario.
 
 
 Mario Golf  series 
 Golf 
   Mario swings a golf ball with (from behind) Toad, Luigi, and Peach watching. 
   Mario after taking a swing with his golf club. In the series, Mario has been portrayed as having a straight trajectory swing. 
 The first time Mario appeared in any sports game was in  Golf  where his proportions are more realistic. In Japanese versions of  Golf ,  Captain Rainbow  would later identify the character as a more generic  Ossan  (although this was one of Mario's initial names during development of  Donkey Kong ). The gameplay is fairly simplistic, but there are obstacles that can impede the ball from landing into the hole.
 
 
 Family Computer Golf: Japan Course  /  Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course 
 Mario additionally appears in  Family Computer Golf: Japan Course  where he is depicted in his normal overalls with his appearance akin to his normal design. In  Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course , the companion of  Family Computer Golf: Japan Course , Mario has a blue shirt and red-and-white striped overalls.
 
 NES Open Tournament Golf 
 In  NES Open Tournament Golf , taking place on  Earth , Mario retains his blue shirt and red-and-white striped overalls. Princess Peach is depicted as Mario's caddy, who helps carry Mario's golf equipment.
 
 Mario Golf  (Nintendo 64) 
 “Welcome to Mario Golf!” 
 — Mario ,  Mario Golf (Nintendo 64) 
 In  Mario Golf  for the Nintendo 64, Mario appears with Luigi at the 18th hole of  Mario's Star . His drive is 270 yards, the second strongest in the game, with only  Bowser  and  Metal Mario  surpassing him, and his shot is Draw. He must be unlocked in single-player mode, but he is default in multiplayer mode.
 
 Mario Golf  (Game Boy Color) 
 Mario also appears in the  Game Boy Color version  under the same name, even though this version is drastically different from the Nintendo 64 version that it can interact with. The game also features a story mode where Mario and other  Mario  characters are not playable.
 
 Mobile Golf 
 Mario appears in the Japan-only  Mobile Golf , but he is unlockable only through the connection of a mobile phone network.
 
 Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour 
 “It's-a me! Mario! Hoo-hoo! I've been on fire lately, but I hope you'll challenge me!” 
 — Mario ,  Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour 
 Mario has appeared in the opening in  Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour . Mario unintentionally interferes with Bowser's chasing of  Wario  and  Waluigi  by hitting Wario's and Waluigi's eyes and Bowser's hand with a golf ball. Bowser drops a  Bob-omb  on Wario and Waluigi, creating an explosion that confuses Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Daisy. At the end, Bowser, Wario, and Waluigi growl at a confused Mario.
 In  Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour , Mario is a default character in all modes. His shot is 212 yards and 280 yards with a star, giving him the fifth strongest drive in the game with a high, straight trajectory. Although he can hit farther than many other characters, his shots are more influenced by the wind due to the his high trajectory, but it can send farther with a favourable wind direction. He has a decently strong impact and the second best spin, only behind Bowser, but his control is very poor, tied with  Diddy Kong  for the second worst in the game and only better than Bowser. When he hits a  Nice Shot , the ball is encased in flames.
 
 Mario Golf: Advance Tour 
 As with  Mario Golf  for the Nintendo 64,  Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour  features a different handheld variant entitled  Mario Golf: Advance Tour , which continues the story from the Game Boy Color version of  Mario Golf . As with its predecessors, Mario and other  Mario  characters are not playable in the story mode.
 
 Mario Golf: World Tour 
 Mario returns in  Mario Golf: World Tour  as a default character. His combination of having the fifth highest drive and straight trajectory makes him a versatile character suited to perform well in many golfing maneuvers, but his control is poor. Mario also has a  gold variant  that featuring identical stats and the inability to use items but awards Mario with a coin per yard depending on how far the ball travels, similar to a permanent  Gold Flower .
 
 Wrecking Crew  series 
 Wrecking Crew 
   Mario smashing blocks in  Wrecking Crew '98 
 In 1985's  Wrecking Crew , Mario and Luigi appear as workers on a demolition site. They use hammers similar to those previously seen in  Donkey Kong  against  Foreman Spike . Unlike its Japan-only "sequel,"  Wrecking Crew '98 , the game has no specific plot. In this game, Mario wears a helmet, shoes, and dark red overalls. Mario faces  Gotchawrenches ,  Eggplant Men , and Foreman Spike. Mario must break all the stone walls before the enemy can. Mario can defeat enemies by trapping them in drums. Foreman Spike can attempt to break blocks himself or push Mario, but Mario can hit him with his hammer and cause him to fall. If Mario stays too long, a  fireball  appears to hinder his progress.
 Mario reappears in  VS. Wrecking Crew , an arcade game for the  VS. System . The game plays similarly to the original with the addition of simultaneous two-player mode, where Mario and another player compete.
 
 Wrecking Crew '98 
 In  Wrecking Crew '98 , Mario finds the Mushroom Kingdom covered with  Bowser 's new high-rises. Foreman Spike also makes a reappearance, along with several other enemies from  Wrecking Crew , this time helping Bowser. These buildings negatively impact the Mushroom Kingdom's environment, so Mario must demolish these structures.
 Unlike in the first game, Mario can hinder his opponent's progress by raining panels on them. To clear the stage, Mario must demolish blocks or arrange three consecutive panels vertically or horizontally. If four or more panels are aligned, Mario can rain panels onto his opponent. If he clears the field, he receives a Mushroom, boosting his offensive combos toward his enemy.
 
 Super Mario  series 
 Super Mario Bros. 
   Artwork of Mario from  Super Mario Bros. 
   The title screen of  Super Mario Bros.  with Mario on the bottom left 
 Since  Super Mario Bros. , Mario is portrayed living in the  Mushroom Kingdom . In the game, Mario's objective is to rescue  Princess Toadstool  (later known as Peach) from  Bowser , the King of the  Koopas . The game is the first in the series in which regular enemies such as  Goombas  can be defeated and  Koopa Troopas  can be stunned by stomping on them from above. Mario can also gain power-ups and coins from jumping against  ? Blocks  and  Brick Blocks . Mario begins the game as  Small Mario , who loses a life from any enemy attack. By using  Super Mushrooms , Mario grows into  Super Mario , who has an additional hit point (reverting to Small Mario after being hit). Super Mario has access to the  Fire Flower , which lets him throw  fireballs  that can knock out enemies such as Koopa Troopas or  fake Bowsers . Mario can also become invincible for a short amount of time with the  Starman .
 Mario's role and powers remain mostly the same in all entries to the series except for  Super Mario Bros. 2 . While new power-ups and moves are introduced, there is no deviation from the basic formula; Mario's basic appearance is unchanged and his personality remains unwritten. Despite this, Mario in the later games has adapted this depiction. Mario's eye color, mustache shape, hairstyle, cap shape, and face shape are all derived from  Super Mario Bros. 
 
 Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels 
 Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels , the sequel of  Super Mario Bros. , features Mario and Luigi's having to rescue Princess Toadstool from Bowser by traveling in new various different lands of the Mushroom Kingdom. The setting, however, is noted as a parallel world of the original Mushroom Kingdom, according to the Japanese manual. A notable harmful element to Mario introduced in  Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels  is the  Poison Mushroom , which can power down or even defeat Mario. Mario's traction and jumping height remain the same, while those of Luigi are changed to differentiate him more from Mario. Luigi jumps higher than Mario but has less traction. This would be a distinguishing feature used in future games.
 
 Super Mario Bros. 2 
   Mario holding a  vegetable 
 In the story of  Super Mario Bros. 2 , based on the Japanese game  Yume KÅjÅ: Doki Doki Panic , Mario has experienced a dream one night. The  fairylike beings  from the land of  Subcon  inform him that  King Wart  has taken over the land of Subcon and that they need Mario's help to defeat Wart. After awakening from his dream, however, Mario dismisses the dream and returns to sleep. The next day, Mario, along with his friends Luigi, Princess Toadstool, and  Toad , decides to go on a picnic. However, while searching for a proper place, Mario and his friends notice a cave and decide to explore within it. After entering the cave, the four friends are transported to Subcon. Mario remembers his dream, and he and his three friends decide to save Subcon from Wart and the  8 bits . Throughout their adventure, Mario and his friends defeat many of Wart's members, including  Birdo  and  Mouser . Eventually, Mario and his three friends confront Wart himself in a battle. After defeating Wart, Mario and his friends save the Subcon fairies and Subcon.
 
   Mario in World 1 of Subcon 
 While the four heroes celebrate their victory, Mario is seen to be awakening during the end of the game, implying the message that the whole adventure is simply a part of Mario's dream. The spiritual sequel,  BS Super Mario USA , explains that Subcon is a dream world, and, while Mario and the others initially thought it is all a dream, they learn the truth about the realm when they are called back into the world to save it from Wart again. They must collect Gold Mario Statues in each level, defeat the boss, and find Wart.
 In contrast to the other characters, Mario is a well-balanced character with no special abilities in  Super Mario Bros. 2  and its sequel, which has the same gameplay mechanics. The gameplay of the two games is vastly different from other  Mario  titles: Enemies can no longer be defeated by stomping them, and Mario gains the power to pick up enemies, lift them over his head, and throw them. This feature is later reused in the  Game Boy  version of  Donkey Kong  and the  Mario vs. Donkey Kong  series of games.
 
 Super Mario Bros. 3 
   Artwork of  Frog Mario  from  Super Mario Bros. 3 
 In  Super Mario Bros. 3 , after Bowser has invaded again, Mario and Luigi travel through eight kingdoms, in which the kings have been transformed into different creatures by the seven  Koopalings . During Mario's quest, he is repeatedly sent letters by Princess Toadstool, who encloses power-ups for him. Eventually, Toadstool is kidnapped, but the Mario Bros. save her from Bowser in the  Dark Land .  Super Mario Bros. 3  introduces a plethora of new power-ups aside from the Fire Flower, including  Super Leaves ,  Tanooki Suits ,  Frog Suits , and  Goomba's Shoes . Mario also encounters new enemies, such as  Thwomps ,  Dry Bones , and  Boos .
 
 Super Mario World 
   Cape Mario  and  Yoshi 
 Super Mario World  introduces  Yoshi  as a sidekick character to Mario. Mario can ride  Yoshis  and so gain varying new powers. Mario meets Yoshi on a holiday in  Dinosaur Land , where Bowser kidnaps Toadstool again, forcing Mario and Luigi to rescue her once again.  Super Mario World  is the first  Mario  game to have a second jump button for a different jumpâthe  Spin Jump âwith which Super Mario can destroy  Rotating Blocks  from above or jump off Yoshi's back; he can also use it to avoid certain obstacles or defeat foes. Mario can use  Cape Feathers  to turn into  Cape Mario , allowing him to take off from the ground and stay in the air for quite a while. Mario can also use  Grab Blocks  and throw them at enemies or obstacles.
 Mario and Luigi defeat the Koopalings in their castles, rescue the captured  eggs , and defeat Bowser in the  Valley of Bowser , rescuing Toadstool and taking her home to  Yoshi's Island  to continue their vacation.
 
 Super Mario 64  /  Super Mario 64 DS 
 “Hello!” 
 — Mario ,  Super Mario 64 
   Mario in  Bob-omb Battlefield 
 
 
 
 
 Artwork of Mario for  Super Mario 64  (left) and his updated appearance in  Super Mario 64 DS  (right) 
 
 
 In  Super Mario 64 , Mario is invited to have a  cake  with Princess Peach at the  Mushroom Castle , but he finds the castle taken over and Peach kidnapped by Bowser when he arrives there. In order to save Peach, Mario has to collect the castle's  Power Stars  to advance further and defeat Bowser. When facing off against Bowser, Mario grabs his tail and spins him around to throw him off the fighting platform. After being rescued, Peach kisses Mario and bakes him the cake.
 Brought into a three-dimensional environment, Mario gains a larger variety of moves. He can jump in multiple waysâbesides the basic jump, jumping from a standstill while  crouching  results in a  backwards somersault , crouching from a run and then jumping gives a  long jump , jumping consecutively while running allows Mario to jump higher (the  triple jump ), quickly changing direction while jumping results in a side  somersault , and jumping off a wall allows Mario to gain height (the  wall jump ). More offensive options are also available: He can  punch ,  kick , slide-attack, and  ground-pound , while he can also crawl under low barriers.
 Power-ups  are gained by collecting caps from  ! Blocks : Red blocks give  Wing Caps , green blocks  Metal Caps , and blue blocks  Vanish Caps . These are temporary, however, and do not fulfill the traditional role of power-ups in giving Mario additional hit pointsâinstead, a  health meter  is introduced for the first time since  Super Mario Bros. 2 . Mario takes damage not only from enemy hits but also from falling from great heights and from time spent underwater. The meter is primarily refilled by collecting  coins , but catching  air bubbles  underwater or swimming on the water's surface also replenishes it. Finally, Mario can lose his normal cap, whereupon he takes greater amounts of damage until he retrieves it.
 In the game's remake,  Super Mario 64 DS , Mario is invited to the Mushroom Castle for cake, along with  Wario  and  Luigi . However, some time after they enter, Bowser overtakes the castle. The trio is thrown behind locked doors, with Mario being sealed away by  Goomboss , who keeps the key to his door.  Yoshi , who has avoided capture by sleeping on the castle's roof, is able to find a portrait of Mario in Peach's room and finds Goomboss. After defeating him, Yoshi unlocks Mario's door with the key he receives.
 From then on, Mario is an additional playable character. He is required to rescue Luigi (while Luigi is needed to rescue Wario). Mario is also required to open the  Big Star Doors  and enter  the final level  to rescue Princess Peach. Mario has average stats, with decent power, speed, swimming, and jumping. His special ability is the balloon-floating power gained by the  Power Flower . Mario can still use the Wings, this game's equivalent to the Wing Cap, which gives him more abilities than the other characters. Mario is also the only character that can wall-jump. Other characters can transform into Mario, gaining his appearance but not his voice, by putting on  Mario's cap . Mario can transform into Luigi and Wario this way but not into Yoshi. The game's story is otherwise identical to that of the original game, and Mario plays much the same way.
 
 Super Mario Sunshine 
 “Aren't I done yet?” 
 — Mario ,  Super Mario Sunshine 
   Mario with F.L.U.D.D. on his back 
 In  Super Mario Sunshine , Mario, Peach, and  Toadsworth  travel to the tropical island of  Isle Delfino  to have a vacation. However, upon arriving on the Delfino Airstrip, they notice some type of  goop  is covering half the area. Mario, responding to Toadsworth's request for help, discovers  F.L.U.D.D.  and, with his help, destroys the  Gatekeeper , cleaning the airstrip. Soon after, however, the  police  arrests Mario and takes him to a jail on the main island.
 
   Mario on trial 
 Mario is then placed on trial against the citizens of Isle Delfino. During the trial, the  prosecutor  explains that Isle Delfino is covered in goop by an unknown entity, though descriptions from various anonymous eyewitnesses have suggested that Mario has vandalized Isle Delfino. Peach and Toadsworth try objecting against the prosecution, but the  judge  overrules the objection quickly, sentencing Mario to clean the island of the goop as community service before leaving, while returning the island's power by collecting  Shine Sprites , the island's source of sunlight.
 
   Mario vs.  Petey Piranha 
 Shadow Mario  soon captures Peach, taking her to  Pinna Island . From there, Mario uses a cannon in Delfino Plaza to come after her and, after chasing Shadow Mario through the island's theme park, arrives at a lake where Shadow Mario unveils  Mecha-Bowser , a huge Bowser-like robot. However, Mario defeats the robot by using  Water Rockets . It is here that Shadow Mario reveals himself to be  Bowser Jr. , Bowser's child. Bowser Jr. then reveals that he had taken Peach because Bowser has told him that Peach is his mother (though Bowser later admits this was a lie meant to get Bowser Jr. to kidnap Peach) and that she is "kidnapped by a bad man named Mario..." Mario, Peach, and F.L.U.D.D. also learn that Bowser Jr. has planted the  graffiti  so Mario can be sent to prison, but it fails. Bowser Jr. then escapes, and he and Peach fly to  Corona Mountain .
 Mario later arrives at the top of the mountain, where Peach, Bowser, and Bowser Jr. are sitting in a hot tub. The interruption enrages Bowser, leading him to fight Marioâbut despite having help from Bowser Jr., who is firing  Bullet Bills  from his raft, Mario still manages to ground-pound all five sections of the hot tub, causing it to flip, sending Mario, Peach, Bowser, and Bowser Jr. falling to the ground. Mario and Peach land on an islet west of Delfino Plaza, where Mario also finds F.L.U.D.D. lying on the ground, highly damaged from the fall and stress of the battle. F.L.U.D.D. then asks if he had truly assisted Mario before shutting off. The two then watch as the final Shine Sprite falls to the  Shine Gate , restoring light to the island.
 
   Mario and Princess Peach watching the sunset at  Sirena Beach . 
 Mario and Peach are then seen at  Sirena Beach , Mario still sad about his loss of F.L.U.D.D. Both then turn around to see the Toads that came with them to the island, one holding F.L.U.D.D., who is now fixed and says, "The vacation starts now!"
 The game removes most jumping, punching, and kicking abilities of the previous game and replaces them with F.L.U.D.D.'s powers. Mario can spray water at enemies and clear goop; the Expansion Nozzles for F.L.U.D.D. can make Mario hover in the air for a short while, make him run at a turbo speed, or rocket him high in the air, although Mario can hold only one Expansion Nozzle at a time. Water for F.L.U.D.D. can be refilled at any body of water in the game or with  Water Bottles . Mario can also ride Yoshis. In the secret levels of the game, Shadow Mario takes F.L.U.D.D. away from Mario, leaving him with only his basic jumping abilities and the  Ground Pound  to beat the stage. When Mario loses his cap in  Super Mario Sunshine , he takes damage from the sun.
 
 New Super Mario Bros. 
 “That's-a so nice!” 
 — Mario ,  New Super Mario Bros. 
   Artwork of Mario from  New Super Mario Bros. 
 New Super Mario Bros.  depicts Mario in a similar plotline and game design to  Super Mario Bros.  The beginning of the game shows Mario and Princess Peach taking a walk outside  Peach's Castle , when both see lightning hit the castle, startling them. Mario quickly runs off to check it, while Peach stays behind and is thus kidnapped by Bowser Jr. The  lightning bolt  at the castle was a distraction for Mario. Throughout the game, Mario chases Bowser Jr. in order to save Princess Peach, battling him in his fortress towers.
 The traditional  Super Mushroom  and  Fire Flower  return, but power-ups also include further size-changing effects induced by the  Mega Mushroom  and the  Mini Mushroom . The Mega Mushroom lets Mario grow to a giant size, allowing him to crush all enemies and obstacles such as  pipes , while the Mini Mushroom has Mario shrink to a tiny size, which gives him access to small pipes.
 Throughout the game, Mario has the option to travel through eight worlds or bypass a few. Mario first faces Bowser at the first of the eight castles, where Mario presses a switch, causing Bowser to fall into the lava. However, Bowser survives as a skeletal version of himself, known as  Dry Bowser . Dry Bowser is fought again in the eighth castle, although he is defeated. 
 Mario eventually arrives at  Bowser's Castle , where Peach is taken after Mario defeats Dry Bowser. Here, Bowser Jr. throws Bowser's bones inside a bubbling pot, reviving him as a somewhat larger version of Bowser. However, despite his larger size and extra strength, Bowser is still beaten when Mario presses the switch, causing Bowser and his son to fall into a pit, thus freeing Princess Peach.
 
 Super Mario Galaxy 
 “Welcome! Welcome, new galaxy!” 
 — Mario ,  Super Mario Galaxy 
   Mario star-spinning in  Super Mario Galaxy 
 Super Mario Galaxy  starts with Mario's invitation to the  Star Festival  by Peach, who has something to give. The event is interrupted by Bowser, however, when he abducts the princess. Mario, after hearing Bowser's plot to create an empire at the center of the universe with Peach, gets blasted by  Kamek  and fails to stop Bowser. When later recovering in the  Gateway Galaxy , Mario is asked by  Rosalina  to rescue the  Power Stars  and  Grand Stars  to power her  Comet Observatory , which can help take them to Bowser and Peach. Mario is given the  Baby Luma , who accompanies him and allows him to  star-spin . Throughout the game, Mario also receives letters from Peach, who sends him  1-Up Mushrooms .
 After several encounters with Bowser, Mario defeats him in  Bowser's Galaxy Reactor . When Mario rides on the final Grand Star, Bowser's star explodes and creates a black hole. Baby Luma shocks Mario by throwing himself into the black hole to prevent Bowser's black hole from consuming everything around it, including Mario, Princess Peach, and the castle. After a big explosion, Mario reappears in an unknown location in front of a large floating Rosalina. Rosalina reassures him that this explosion is just the mark of a new universe. Mario then awakens in a restored world, near Peach's Castle. He also sees Bowser and Princess Peach awaken intact. He takes time adjusting to this new world around him before happily embracing it. During a special cutscene after Mario has collected 120 Stars, Rosalina thanks him before leaving in her Comet Observatory.
 Most of the jumping mechanics present in  Super Mario 64 , such as Long Jumps, somersaults, and Triple Jumps, return. New powers include the Star Spin (which replaces Mario's punch/kick/slide offensive moves in  Super Mario 64 ) and the Wii pointer, which can be controlled independently from Mario. The Wii pointer can shoot enemies or grab  Star Bits  without controlling Mario. Additionally, Mario can get assistance by another player in Co-Star Mode, who can help gather Star Bits, shoot Star Bits, stun enemies, and assist in his jumping. Finally, Mario can find new sets of temporary power-ups that aid him in completing levels, such as the  Bee Mushroom ,  Ice Flower ,  Red Star ,  Rainbow Star , and  Fire Flower .

   Mario in  New Super Mario Bros. Wii 
   Mario riding Yoshi 
 Mario's role and basic abilities in  New Super Mario Bros. Wii  remain the same as in its  predecessor , although there are a few added power-ups, such as the  Propeller Mushroom  and the  Penguin Suit . The story, while still basic, is slightly differentâin the cutscene at the beginning of the game, Mario, Luigi, and many Toads, including  Blue Toad  and  Yellow Toad , are celebrating  Princess Peach 's birthday when a cake suddenly walks into the castle. When Peach moves closer to the cake,  Bowser Jr.  and the Koopalings jump out of the cake and throw it onto Peach. Mario, Luigi, and the Toads then give chase, and Mario once again fights his way through eight worlds in his attempt to rescue Peach. After Mario rescues Princess Peach, the princess tells Mario about secret World 9, extending his adventure. 
 
 
 Super Mario Galaxy 2 
 “Thank you so much for playing my game!” 
 — Mario ,  Super Mario Galaxy 2 
   Mario riding Yoshi in  Super Mario Galaxy 2 
 Super Mario Galaxy 2  has Mario involved in a more minimalist story compared to its predecessor,  Super Mario Galaxy . Before arriving at the castle, Mario finds Luma lying on the ground. Luma then flies into his cap again, giving him his old spinning ability. However, when Mario arrives at Peach's Castle, a giant Bowser kidnaps Peach. Mario gives chase by using a  Launch Star .
 After finding a Star in the first galaxy, Mario finds a small planetoid that a group of Lumas, led by  Lubba , is using to travel around. Lubba then explains that earlier, Bowser found them, took their Star power, and left the ship in disrepair. The crew of Lumas then uses its power to transform the ship, giving it the appearance of Mario's head, and it is named  Starship Mario . Being named the captain, Mario flies off to collect Power Stars in order to reach Bowser and Princess Peach.
 Aside from additional power-ups and the addition of Yoshi, the gameplay is identical to the first  Super Mario Galaxy  game. Mario defeats Bowser and saves Peach in the end. Rosalina and her  Comet Observatory  appear before Mario and Peach. Rosalina thanks Mario for watching over the Luma that he has found, and the Luma returns to the Comet Observatory, along with Mario's cap. Mario and his companions return to the Mushroom Kingdom.
 
 
 Super Mario 3D Land 
   Mario as he appears in  Super Mario 3D Land 
 Mario appears in  Super Mario 3D Land  for the  Nintendo 3DS . He uses several classic power-ups, notably the Tanooki Suit from  Super Mario Bros. 3 . He once again saves Princess Peach from Bowser's clutches. 
 After a storm, all the Tanooki Leaves are blown from the  Tail Tree  outside Peach's Castle. The next day, Mario and three Toads investigate the scene when they notice a floating letter. They open it to discover that Bowser kidnapped Peach while she was checking the damage to the tree. Mario and the Toads then run to rescue her. During the adventure, Mario battles several enemies old and new, including  Boom Boom  and  Pom Pom . While running through the worlds, Mario receives letters from Peach to learn about her situation. Mario also encounters Bowser Impostors throughout the adventure.
 
   Mario and an Invincibilty Leaf 
 Mario fights Bowser at Bowser's Castle, activating the switch on the other side of the bridge and sending Bowser into the lava. The area beside the castle contains only a cage lying on its side, however. Mario enters a door and finds Peach, but, upon running over to her, he finds out that it is only a wooden cutout. Bowser then emerges, carrying the real princess, and flees to his second castle.
 After heading through another level, Mario reaches Bowser's second castle and the princess, who is this time tied to the flagpole. Bowser then appears and the two begin their battle. This time, Mario has to navigate an obstacle course to get to the bridge and eventually the switch at the end. He pushes this, sending Bowser into the lava below. Bowser quickly emerges from the lava, however, and Mario has to reach another switch in order to actually defeat him. Pushing the switch once again sends Bowser falling into the lava below. Mario then reappears back at the flagpole and frees the princess. Mario, along with three Toads, then uses a Super Leaf to get himself and the princess back home.
 Some time after that, Mario receives a letter from Luigi, depicting Luigi in captivity. Mario runs through  Special 1  and frees Luigi from  Dry Bowser . Then, yet again, Peach is captured by Bowser. Mario goes back to his castle and defeats him once more. Once Mario gets five stars in his profile, the level  Special 8-Crown  is unlocked. There, he goes through an obstacle course where  Boom Boom  and  Pom Pom  are fought for the last time. This time, Boom Boom has a track of flames. When they are defeated, a giant "THANK YOU" appears while Toads surround the final  Goal Pole  of the game.
 
 New Super Mario Bros. 2 
   Raccoon Mario artwork in  New Super Mario Bros. 2 
 Mario once again appears as the main protagonist of  New Super Mario Bros. 2 . In this game, Mario can once again become Raccoon Mario, first seen in  Super Mario Bros. 3 .  Gold Mario  (as well as the  Gold Flower ) is introduced as Mario's newest form. In this form, he can throw fireballs that transform solid objects (blocks) into coins for him to collect. It is also the introduction of  White Raccoon Mario , a form obtainable from  Invincibility Leaves  gotten from  Assist Blocks . The form gives Mario the power of invincibility and all of the abilities of Raccoon Mario.
 In the game, Mario and Luigi are visiting Princess Peach and leave her castle in Tanooki form, with the princess waving them off, to collect coins in the sky. As soon as they land, the Koopalings appear in the Koopa Clown Car and slam into the ground, causing the brothers to lose their raccoon powers. The Koopalings reveal that they have taken Princess Peach once again, and the brothers give chase. As they travel through the six worlds, the brothers must find secret worlds, battle  Reznors , who make a return, and the Koopalings, and search for coins. At the very end, they confront Bowser, who is powered up by the Koopalings after his first defeat. However, in classic Mario style, the Mario Bros. use a switch to drop Bowser into a pit. Peach is rescued and the brothers return home.
 There is another mode in the game,  Coin Rush , in which Mario must collect as many coins as possible in three random courses within the time limit and without dying once. There are  + Clocks  scattered throughout the courses, while Mario also gets more time by hitting  Checkpoint Flags . Reaching the top of the flagpole doubles Mario's coin count, and defeating enemies as Gold Mario or after a  Gold Ring  is triggered awards additional coins.
 
 
 New Super Mario Bros. U 
   Mario jumping together with Luigi, Yellow Toad, and Blue Toad in  New Super Mario Bros. U 
 Mario appears again as the protagonist in  New Super Mario Bros. U . Once again, he must save the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser and his minions as he travels with his allies  Luigi ,  Blue Toad ,  Yellow Toad , and his new allies,  Miis . After Bowser kidnaps Peach, Mario and his allies are thrown into a tree, releasing  Super Acorns . He gets a new form,  Flying Squirrel Mario , when he collects them. In this form, Mario can glide and cling to walls. The upgraded  P-Acorn  allows him to fly indefinitely. His old power-ups, including but not limited to the  Super Mushroom ,  Fire Flower , and  Ice Flower , return. The Penguin Suit and Propeller Suit from  New Super Mario Bros. Wii  also return, but they are found only in certain Toad Houses and in Challenge Mode.
 In this game, Mario discovers  Baby Yoshis  that aid him on his adventure by providing light, emitting bubbles, or floating. During his adventure, he encounters new enemies, including but not limited to  Waddlewings ,  Nabbit , and  Goombrats . To save Princess Peach, Mario must travel to a Koopaling's airship and defeat that Koopaling to proceed. Meanwhile, Bowser modifies Peach's Castle according to his tastes. When Mario finally arrives at Peach's Castle, it is conquered, and he must enter the modified castle to defeat Bowser and rescue Peach.
 Unlike in  New Super Mario Bros. Wii , when Mario collects 99 lives, he keeps his cap.
 In the downloadable content  New Super Luigi U , Mario himself does not appear, the first time this has occurred in the entire  Super Mario  series. However, in the opening sequence, his cap appears on the table. Additionally, at the beginning of the  Frosted Glacier  level  Broozers and Barrels , a snowman with Mario's face and a cap with his "M" on it can be seen.
 
 New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe 
 Mario reappears as a playable character in  New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe . Mario remains a non-playable character in  New Super Luigi U . When a  Super Guide Block  appears in  New Super Luigi U , however, a computer-controlled Mario now appears to complete a level for the player.

   From left: Toad, Peach, Mario, and Luigi in their Cat forms 
 Mario returns in  Super Mario 3D World  and its  Nintendo Switch port , alongside  Luigi ,  Princess Peach , and  Toad , as an all-round character, in a similar way to  Super Mario Bros. 2 , lacking the special abilities of the other three characters. After Bowser has kidnapped the  Sprixie Princesses , Peach falls into the pipe that leads to the  Sprixie Kingdom , and Mario, Toad, and Luigi follow. There, they cooperate on their adventure to reach Bowser. During the adventure, Mario encounters new items, most notably the  Super Bell , which transforms him into  Cat Mario . He also encounters new enemies, such as  Cat Goombas , and old enemies, including  Chargin' Chucks . Boom Boom and Pom Pom also reappear to hinder Mario's progress, while new bosses, such as  Hisstocrat , are additional impediments. Once Mario and his teammates reach the end of  World Castle , the seventh world, Bowser retreats into another world, the amusement park of  World Bowser . Once Mario and his friends finally reach Bowser, Bowser transforms himself into  Meowser  and climbs a huge tower. Mario and his friends then hit the large  POW Block  at the peak of the tower, defeating Bowser, transforming him into a large firework. They then proceed to rescue the Sprixie Princesses before using a clear pipe to return to the Mushroom Kingdom.
 
 Super Mario Maker 
 “Hey! Let's get making!” 
 — Mario ,  Super Mario Maker 
   Mario gluing a wing to a  ? Block 
 Mario appears as the sole playable character in the  Wii U  level-creation game  Super Mario Maker . However, Mario can make use of  Mystery Mushrooms  to take on the appearances of a variety of other characters (including non- Mario  characters). Also, a number of unlockable Mystery Mushroom  costumes  alter Mario's sprite to a different iteration of himself, listed below.
 
 Mario ( Super Mario Bros. ): A recolor of Mario's original  Super Mario Bros.  sprite that uses his modern colors. Upon Mario grabbing the Mystery Mushroom, the sound effect after exiting a pipe in  Tiny-Huge Island  and in the opening of  Super Mario 64  can be heard. The "Course Clear" tune is replaced by the one heard after obtaining a  Power Star  in that game. Mario's jumping sound effects are also replaced by  Super Mario World 's. The death tune is the "Game Over" tune from  Super Mario 64 , and the invincibility tune is replaced with the Wing Mario tune from that same game. [13]  This costume is also used for  Big Mario's  modern appearance, but it does not use any of the costume's unique sound effects and is able to wear  Buzzy Shells  and  Spiny Shells . This costume is unlocked either at random upon completion of the 100-Mario Challenge or by scanning a compatible Mario  amiibo . 
 Silver Mario ( Super Mario Maker ): A silver palette swap of Mario's modernized  Super Mario Bros.  sprite.

 Super Mario Bros.: Peach-hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen! 
   Mario and Luigi surrounded by mushroom people 
 Mario is featured in a feature-length anime adaption of  Super Mario Bros. ,  Super Mario Bros.: Peach-hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen! , roughly translated to "Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!" In the beginning of the film, Princess Peach interrupts Mario's video game session by jumping out of the television and requests him to protect her. Mario agrees, but  King Koopa  succeeds in kidnapping her. Mario and Luigi almost dismiss it as a dream, but Mario finds an emerald necklace from Princess Peach. Working at the grocery store, Luigi notices Mario holding the pendant and then, identifying the gem from a book he has read, believes it can guide them to the Mushroom Kingdom, where they can get rich. Mario tries to call the author of the book, and he answers, already knowing his name. A dog-like creature,  Kibidango , however, steals the necklace. Mario and Luigi chase the dog and enter a  Warp Pipe , where they find  Kinoko Sennin , the author of the book. He tells them that the Mushroom Kingdom is being attacked and Princess Peach believed from a prophecy that Mario and Luigi can save it, but King Koopa has taken her because she has rejected his proposal to marry her. Mario, angry and motivated, wants to rescue Peach and her kingdom, so Kinoko Sennin advises they get help from the mushroom, flower, and star, scattered in the kingdom. Luigi becomes encouraged by the coins he may find along the way, so he joins Mario along with Kibidango.
 On their adventure, two Goombas watch their progress and try to impede them. The first time, they tell a famished Luigi that they know of delicious mushrooms and lead him to a field of mushrooms that cause erratic effects to him, such as laughing and crying. Mario struggles to get Luigi to normal, but a  colossal-sized Paratroopa  interferes and tries feeding him to her chicks. Mario finds a mushroom in a block of ice and tries to climb to reach it, but he reveals a rock that shoots coins. This surprises him and causes him to fall, but he lands safely. Luigi then finds out that the coins have transformed to mushroom people. One, called Toad, explains that King Koopa has transformed them to coins and thanks Mario and Luigi for rescuing them. They give Mario and Luigi a key item, a Super Mushroom, and let Mario, Luigi, and Kibidango continue on their way. Mario uses this mushroom to help fend off enemies, such as  giant-sized Koopa Troopas  and Bullet Bills, along the way.
 Mario and Luigi meet these two Goombas again, and the Goombas lead them to a field infested with Piranha Plants. They narrowly escape but anger a Lakitu in the process for disturbing its flowers. Lakitu throws  Spiny's eggs  at Mario and Luigi, though Mario and Luigi taunt at it for missing. Lakitu then summons rain to cause these eggs to morph into  big-sized Spinies . It also causes a  beanstalk  to grow and trick Lakitu for a moment to think Mario is defeated, but Mario grabs some of the cloud before Lakitu realizes and escapes. Mario eventually saves Luigi and Kibidango when he triggers the cloud to snow and make the Spinies hibernate. This cloud then transforms into another Toad, who thanks Mario and gives him a Fire Flower. This flower helps Mario defeat more enemies with fire, including a  big-sized Buzzy Beetle .
 
   Mario locked in after being led into a cave 
 After resting and eating, Luigi leads Mario and Kibidango into a cave, but they are immediately locked in. Mario sees the two Goombas and begs for forgiveness, but the Goombas refuse and consider their mission to stop Mario, Luigi, and Kibidango successful. They leave a Hammer Brother to guard the prison cell. While waiting in the cell, Mario gets a daydream of dancing with Peach, but Luigi has found a way to escape. Mario, however, is still in his daydream and winds up kissing the Hammer Brother. The three then quickly leave. When they escape, Luigi realizes that these coins are fake and tosses them into the water while also accidentally tossing a star into it. Realizing the mistake, Mario and Kibidango swim to try to get it while avoiding many fish, including  mega-sized Cheep-cheeps . They grab the star, which is hidden in a  clam , but retreat in a sunken ship for safety. They steer this ship out of the water, and they reunite with Luigi. Riding the ship, Mario, Luigi, and Kibidango have the three items and are prepared to face King Koopa and crash his wedding ceremony.
 They are spotted when Peach notices them approaching the castle. Mario and Kibidango enter the area through a hole in the wall and see King Koopa. They then chase him while Luigi searches for treasure. Mario and Kibidango arrive at a lava pit, and the two Goombas, with a control panel, challenge Mario to jump across elevator platforms. Meanwhile, however, Luigi finds a leak and floods the room with water. While Mario is saved, the water causes the castle to collapse. Among the remains, Mario sees King Koopa grab Peach, and he is ready to fight Mario. Kibidango reminds Mario to use the power-ups. Mario does use the Super Mushroom and the Fire Flower, but he is distracted by more food, and King Koopa manages to damage and throw him. Peach begs King Koopa for forgiveness and is even willing to marry him as long as Mario is spared. King Koopa hesitates but wants to destroy Mario since Mario has yet to use the Super Star. King Koopa tries to squish Mario and Luigi, but Mario uses his Star and manages to fight and defeat King Koopa.
 At the end, the castle is restored to Peach's Castle and the landscape becomes lush. Princess Peach thanks Mario, and he returns her pendant. Peach talks about another half of the pendant, which Mario promises to find. Kibidango, however, transforms into Haru-Åji of Flower-koku. He is the keeper of the other half and is about to marry Peach, but King Koopa has cursed him into his dog form. This devastates Mario, but Princess Peach thanks him, and Mario and Luigi promise her help whenever she needs it. At the end of the movie, King Koopa and the Koopa Troop are shown working as employees for Mario and Luigi's grocery store.

Mario is captured, although his capture varies between versions of the game.
 In the DOS version, Mario enters the castle alone, as Luigi is too scared to follow. Mario meets Bowser, who is in a butler disguise, and accepts candy from him, despite Luigi's warning not to take candy from strangers. Bowser uses this as a distraction to trap Mario in a net. Despite his captured status, however, Mario in that version nonetheless manages to give contact to Luigi to guide him to the continents to stop Bowser's plans, as well as update him on the situation. Over the course of the game, Mario tells Luigi that he admitted to Bowser that he has a fear of the dark, which strained communication since Bowser is threatening him with his fear. In the NES version, Mario is captured outside in the snow by a Koopa with a bag. In that version, he also reacts angrily to the title shortly before being captured by the Koopa. In the SNES version, Mario gets trapped inside a pitfall outside the castle.
 The game centers around Luigi, who rescues Mario from Bowser in the end.
 
 Super Mario-Kun

The manga volumes typically depict Mario along with Yoshi or Luigi, although he sometimes befriends other partners to aid him.

There are six types of cookies he must match. Mario can also face against Princess Peach, Yoshi, or Bowser in the VS mode of the game, where he must maintain a higher lit fuse than his opponent by clearing rows of cookies. Matching five Yoshi Cookies gives a special move that can disrupt the opponent's playing field.

 Super Mario Adventures 
   Mario and Luigi fixing the castle pipes in the beginning of  Super Mario Adventures 
 Super Mario Adventures  features Mario and Luigi attempting to rescue Princess Toadstool, and it features characters and other elements from  Super Mario World . In the beginning, Mario and Luigi arrive at Toadstool's palace to work. A party is scheduled, but Mario and Luigi find a tangle of pipes, so the two set to work. Mario notices an unfamiliar green pipe. It and several other green pipes spawn enemies, and Mario and Luigi flee outside, where they find many green pipes. Bowser, with the Koopalings, then appears and blackmails Princess Toadstool. If she does not marry him, he turns her kingdom into stone. He demonstrates by transforming several Toads to stone. Later, when the Toads try to reach Mario and Luigi, it is revealed that Mario has been turned to stone. Princess Toadstool, defiant, pursues Bowser for a negotiation. The Toad attendants call the  Minister of Massage  to restore Mario to normal, which he accomplishes after one week. After Toads tell him what has happened, Mario and Luigi decide to chase Bowser, so they enter the large green pipe. Below, however, is the sky, and Mario and Luigi plummet.
 After Mario pulls Luigi from the ground, Mario sees Luigi holding on to an egg. They try to cook it, but it hatches into a Yoshi. Mario and Luigi, who are unfamiliar with Yoshi, try to flee, believing that the Yoshi will eat them. Mario hides in a bush and beckons Luigi to follow. Luigi tries to, but he panics after sitting on a  Wiggler . Mario stomps on its head, enraging it and giving it chase to the brothers. They then spot Yoshi still following them, and they brace themselves. The Yoshi and the Wiggler fight, and Mario and Luigi try to sneak away. They then see the Yoshi eat the Wiggler, and they hear it talk and beckon Mario and Luigi to give it a ride. The two decide that it is friendly, so they ride it. Yoshi takes them to a Yoshi village. Still uncertain, they wonder if the Yoshis are going to prepare them as part of a meal. They find  Friendly Floyd , a traveling salesman. He informs them that they are in a Yoshi village and thanks them for rescuing Yoshi. They ask why Yoshi was sealed in an egg, and he explains that it was Bowser's curse inflicted on him while he was setting out to rescue Yoshis from Bowser. Floyd offers to sell them a Yoshi interpreter book, though Mario and Luigi convince him to lower the price. After buying the book, however, they discover that it is useless. They then find one of Toadstool's guards, from Toadstool's expedition to Bowser's Castle, who tells them that Princess Toadstool is captured.
 Mario and Luigi soon arrive at the castle and see it covered in a moat. Mario attempts to swim through it but is attacked by  Urchins ,  Fish Bones , and  Porcupuffers . Mario and Luigi see Friendly Floyd but try to ignore him. Luigi sits on a  Bill Blaster , but Mario panics and tries to knock him off. The blaster fires a  Bullet Bill , which catches Mario. He zooms past Princess Toadstool flying with her cape, who has escaped in the meantime. Mario crash-lands in the castle and is promptly captured. While he is sitting in his cell, Luigi is given blackmail to give the princess or watch Mario suffer. Luigi, with help from Friendly Floyd, disguises himself as Princess Toadstool, and he successfully tricks Bowser. Luigi visits Mario in his cell, causing Mario to snicker. Wendy finds Luigi and tells them both that she is going to feed Mario to the piranhas. Luigi hastily changes the subject and tells the Koopalings that he orders pizza. The pizza arrives, and it turns out to be Princess Toadstool in Luigi's clothes, who, with several bombs, threatens the Koopalings to blow up the castle. Luigi then reveals himself. Wendy believes it is a bluff, though the Koopalings charge. Luigi steals the keys from Roy. He jumps too high, however, and he drops the keys. The Toad catches the keys and rides on Yoshi. He quietly passes the keys to Luigi while the Koopalings are chasing him and Yoshi. Luigi goes to Mario's cell and struggles to open both the cell lock and the prison chain lock. While Yoshi, Toad, and Toadstool are cornered, Mario is free and takes out the enemies. Wendy opens a trapdoor and sends Mario, Luigi, Toad, Toadstool, and Yoshi into a pit. The fires from the  Reznors  in the pit set off Toadstool's bomb, and there is a massive explosion.
 After they all land safely, Luigi and Toadstool swap their clothes to normal, and Mario, Luigi, Toadstool, and Toad feel their adventure is done. They, however, quickly realize that they must re-enter the pipe from the sky, the pipe they fell from. Toad gets an idea and borrows Princess Toadstool's cape to fly and send rescue units. He leaves, and after a while, Mario spots units and a ladder coming from the pipe. They attempt to climb the ladder. The leading Toad, however, kicks Mario below, and he slices off the ladder below him. The rescue unit is revealed to be Bowser and his troops, disguised, and the real Toad has been captured. Bowser sends Paratroops after them. Yoshi eats a Blue Shell and starts flying, but he loses Bowser and his troops. Yoshi spits out his shell, and Mario and Luigi crash into a dark forest.
 Mario hesitates to enter the  Ghost House  (it is actually a trap set by Bowser), but Luigi is hit with hunger pangs. While Mario argues with him, they smell cheese coming from the house, and Luigi runs in. Mario and Yoshi chase him, but Yoshi is hit by the door and throws Mario inside. Bowser activates the door to be shut, leaving Yoshi outside. While getting attacked by  Boos , Mario searches for Luigi. He finds Luigi in a room with a big chunk of cheese. He alerts Luigi to Boos, and Luigi flees with Mario. Mario tells Luigi to stick to the walls. Without realizing it, however, they slip in front of a hallway with  Big Boo  inside, and they are exposed from behind. Luigi falls backward, sees the Big Boo, and yells. Mario turns around, and the Boos they were facing attack them. This leads to a stand-off that lasts for a while. Mario gets tired but has a plan, so he leads Luigi into an empty room. When the Boos enter, they are greeted by Mario, dressed as a psychologist, with Luigi as a nurse. Mario tells the Boo that it is scared of humans and asks it to talk about its past. He successfully cheers up the Boo by telling it about the massive universe they are in. He then tells it to go outside. The Boo thanks him, and it answers Mario's question as to where Bowser's Castle is. Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi then head there.
 Looking at the beginning of the wedding ceremony, Mario notes the tight security. He, Luigi, and Yoshi try entering a pipe they believe will take them inside. In the tunnel, they reach a lava chamber. They encounter  Thwomps  and  Blarggs  that attack them. While Luigi and Yoshi are on a rock island, Mario reaches a pipe. Exiting the pipe, which leads outside the wedding cake, Mario tries to crash the wedding ceremony. He seems surprised to see Toadstool (not realizing she is hypnotized) calling Bowser her "darling," but he grabs her and tries to escape. He promptly gets beaten and tied up. Meanwhile, however, Luigi and Yoshi find an alternate route. Mario then sees escaped Yoshis (which Luigi and Yoshi have freed from their eggs) stampeding. They trample the Magikoopa hypnotist, breaking the spell. Princess Toadstool unties Mario, and he uses the rope to snag Bowser, who tries to flee. Bowser hides in the cake, but the Yoshis start eating it. Mario finds him, but Bowser tries charging into him. Realizing that the cake will collapse, Mario gets off the cake, and the cake collapses, defeating Bowser. Princess Toadstool kisses Mario, and the Yoshis are freed. Mario, Luigi, and Toadstool return to the Mushroom Kingdom for rest and celebration until their next adventure.
 
 Mario Kart  series 
 “Welcome to Mario Kart!” 
 — Mario ,  Mario Kart 64 
   LINE  sticker of Mario performing a trick 
   Mario paired with Luigi 
 In the series of  Mario Kart  games, starting with  Super Mario Kart , Mario has always been a playable character. In games where characters are divided into weight groups, Mario always has middling weight with balanced statistics. Numerous tracks throughout the series have been called  Mario Circuit , or something with the name "Mario" in it.
 Mario appears in the  Mario Kart  series in the first installment:  Super Mario Kart . Mario is average in all categories. When used by a computer, he sometimes uses Star power, which gives him invincibility. Mario is used again for  Mario Kart 64 , where he is featured as a middleweight average-stats character. In  Mario Kart: Super Circuit , Mario is once again used as middleweight characters with average speed and weight.
 In  Mario Kart: Double Dash!! , he is grouped with  Luigi  by default, and their special item is the  Fireball . His kart is the  Red Fire , which is an all-around average kart. His baby version, Baby Mario, also makes his debut.
 Mario once again returns as a character in  Mario Kart DS . His karts are the  B Dasher , the  Standard MR , and the  Shooting Star . After beating the game, Mario can race in any of the karts. He also fights two bosses in Mission Mode:  Eyerok  in Level 2 and  Wiggler  in Level 7. Mario later returns as a character for  Mario Kart Wii . Unlike the previous installment, in  Mario Kart Wii , Mario can ride on any of the medium karts and bikes. Mario also provides a small boost to handling, weight, and acceleration on any vehicle he drives. Mario returns as a playable character in  Mario Kart 7 . Like in the previous titles, he is a medium class racer, and most of his stat boosts are around average levels. Mario's metallic rival,  Metal Mario , also makes his debut in the  Mario Kart  series.
 
   Official artwork of Mario from  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 
 In  Mario Kart 8 , Mario is yet again a middleweight, sharing this distinction with not just Luigi but also  Ludwig von Koopa  and  Iggy Koopa . His stats, however, are not perfectly balanced. His top speed and traction are his strongest stats, while his acceleration is his weakest stat. If Mario drives certain vehicles, they are colored red to match Mario's dominant color. The exceptions are the  GLA  and  City Tripper . Unlike in  Mario Kart Wii , Mario can ride on any vehicle in the game. As with every character playable in  Mario Kart 8 , Mario is playable again in  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe .
 In  Mario Kart Arcade GP , he is an all-around type and shares his special character items with Luigi. His special items are a Star, which gives Mario invincibility; a fireball, which can be shot forward or backward to damage a kart; the hammer, which can hit a rival, giving them damage; and the Chain Chomp, which provides damage to any kart it hits. Mario then appeared in  Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 , the sequel to the original. Mario, like Luigi, Pac-Man, and Waluigi, is an all-around racer. Mario reappears in  Mario Kart Arcade GP DX  as yet again a balanced middleweight character. His personal kart is the  Lightning Champ . He also received a Fire Mario alternate palette swap.
 Mario reappears in  Mario Kart Tour  as a playable character. He is available as a Super character in said game; his special item is the  Fire Flower . Mario also has a self-titled cup in the game. In addition, Mario in his musician outfit from  Super Mario Odyssey  (referred to in-game as "Mario (Musician)") appears as a separate, High-End playable character available as the second High-End Spotlight driver of the New York Tour with  Double Bob-ombs  as his special item; Mario (Musician) has different  trick  animations and a few distinct quotes as well. Mario in his hakama outfit from  Super Mario Odyssey  (which the game similarly refers to as "Mario (Hakama)") also appears as a separate, High-End playable character, available as the second High-End Spotlight driver of the Tokyo Tour. Mario (Hakama)'s special item is the  Coin Box , which continually releases coins onto the track while in use. Mario in a  Santa Claus  costume, referred to as "Mario (Santa)," was added as another separate driver as the first High-End Spotlight driver of the Winter Tour, with the Fire Flower being his special item (like his normal counterpart). [16]  Mario in his Happi outfit from  Super Mario Odyssey  (which the game similarly refers to as "Mario (Happi)") is a High-End Spotlight driver of the New Year's Tour with the  Bob-omb Cannon  as his special item. In addition, Mario in his classic outfit is a High-End Spotlight driver of the Mario Bros. Tour with the  Triple Mushrooms  as his special item. Two more variants based on his Chef and Swimwear outfits from  Super Mario Odyssey  (which the game similarly refers to as "Mario (Chef)" and "Mario (Swimwear)") also appear, with the  Lucky Seven  and  Dash Ring  as their special items, respectively. Another variant based on Mario's sprites from  Super Mario Kart  (which the game similarly refers to as "Mario (SNES)") is a High-End Spotlight driver of the Super Mario Kart Tour with the Triple Mushrooms as his special item.
 
 Mario Paint 
 Mario played a minor role in  Mario Paint . He appears in the interactive title screen, although he also makes appearances for a few icons. In the game, players can paint, create sprites, create music, and animate. Mario's icon during music mode indicates a piano-like instrument.
 
 Mario's Time Machine 
   Mario in his time machine 
 In  Mario's Time Machine , Bowser uses a time machine to steal various artifacts from different time periods of human history in order to display them at his museum. Mario goes on a mission to return all objects of Bowser's museum to their original time periods in order to prevent history from being altered. Additionally, Mario has to rescue Yoshi from Bowser in the NES version of the game.  Mario's Time Machine  is one of the few games in which Mario talks.
 In the NES version, the player has to play an altered version of  Mario Bros.  to defeat Koopa Troopas, who drop the stolen objects when defeated. Mario then has to travel back in time to return the objects to their proper places in a side-scrolling mission.
 In the SNES version, Mario has to pick a stolen object from the museum and then go to a "Time Surfing" level to collect enough Mushrooms to make a time jump, then return the objects to their proper places.
 
 
 Mario & Wario 
 In  Mario & Wario , Mario is a passive character. Wario drops buckets or barrels or similar objects on his head, blinding him. The fairy  Wanda  has to guide Mario safely to Luigi through hazards and traps in each level. When arriving at the end of the level, Luigi frees Mario from the sight-blocking object. Mario is only one of the characters that have to be guided through levels by Wanda like this in the game. The other characters are Princess Peach and Yoshi. Mario walks at a medium speed, while Peach is slow and Yoshi is fast.
 
 Mario's Early Years!  series 
 Mario has appeared in the  Mario's Early Years!  series, which consists of three games. Mario, by traveling to different worlds, teaches basic learning skills to younger players, such as counting, recognizing shapes, and basic spelling. Mario is controlled by a cursor interacting with an object.
 
 Mario's Picross  series 
   
 Mario is featured as an archaeologist in  Mario's Picross .  Mario's Picross  is a puzzle game where Mario must scrape squares according to the numbered indicators on each column and row. Completing the puzzle correctly usually shows an image, sometimes referring to earlier games in the  Mario  series. During the gameplay, Mario is also given hints such as an entire row being scraped correctly or a roulette that determines which lines are revealed. Mario reappears in the sequel,  Picross 2 , where now, he must match boxes and link them to form specific images. Mario again appears in  Mario's Super Picross  on the  Super Famicom . As in  Picross 2 , Wario also appears in it. Mario is given a set of rules, where he works under a time limit and gets penalized if he makes a mistake. Wario, on the other hand, has no time limit, but mistakes are not apparent and no hints are given.
 
 Hotel Mario 
   Mario seen in a cutscene from  Hotel Mario 
 In  Hotel Mario , Mario and Luigi travel to the Mushroom Kingdom after an invitation for a picnic by Princess Peach. Upon arriving, the two find out that Peach has been kidnapped by Bowser, who has made her a "permanent guest" in one of his seven  Koopa hotels . Mario and Luigi travel from one Koopaling's hotel to the next, with Peach being brought to a new hotel every time the brothers have searched through the last one. After destroying most of the Koopaling hotels, Mario fights Bowser in his  own hotel  and defeats him. He then receives a kiss from Princess Peach, then congratulates the player as "the best ever."
 In the game, Mario has to close all doors in a hotel in order to proceed. Mario can stomp on enemies to defeat them, similar to in the  Super Mario  series. He can also hide in open doors and take elevators to change his level.
 On a side note, Mario has four fingers instead of the normal five in this game.
 
 
 Excitebike: Bun Bun Mario Battle Stadium

 Mario Tennis  series 
   Mario and Peach in a match against Bowser and Luigi in  Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash 
 Mario is a playable character in all games of the  Mario Tennis  series. In all direct games in the seriesâ Mario Tennis  for the Nintendo 64,  Mario Power Tennis  for the Nintendo GameCube and Wii,  Mario Tennis: Power Tour  for the Game Boy Advance,  Mario Tennis Open  for the Nintendo 3DS,  Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash  for the Wii U, and  Mario Tennis Aces  for the Nintendo Switchâhe is an all-around character. In  Mario Tennis  for the Game Boy Color, Mario is an unlockable character, unlocked by completing the Singles Mario Tour.
 In the intro for the game  Mario Tennis  for the  Nintendo 64 , Mario is one of the participants of the tournament. Here, he defeats  Donkey Kong  to gain access to the semifinals. In the semifinals, he defeats  Yoshi  and moves on to the finals against  Luigi . While the two brothers are looking for the missing tennis ball prior to the match,  Wario  and his partner,  Waluigi , appear and cause mischief. After this,  Bowser  and a  Boo  appear. Everyone stands back in fear, thinking that the two came to cause trouble as well. But Bowser and Boo reveal that they simply want to play a nice game of tennis, to which Mario exclaims, "Let's all play!" and all of them agree and cheer. Initially unknown to the cast, however, a  Bob-omb  walks onto the court and explodes. In this game, Mario is the referee who wears different outfits depending on the tournament. If he is playing, a clone of him sits on the referee's chair and wears a blue version of Mario's cap. He reads "0" as "oh" during tiebreakers.
 
   Mario playing tennis 
 In  Mario Power Tennis , Mario and Luigi are the only all-around characters. Unlike in other games, Mario and Luigi have subtle differences within each other. While they have nearly identical movement speed, Mario has more power, while Luigi has slightly more reach and more control. Mario, when compared to other characters, has a slightly below-average reach and lunge because of his short stature. Mario is stronger than most non-power characters. All his other stats are average. Mario's  Offensive Power Shot  has his racket transform into a giant mallet, which enables him to hit the ball with high speed and force; opponents that return the ball may get blasted to the back of the court. Mario's  Defensive Power Shot  is a simple spin that allows him to reach lobs and faraway balls quickly, but it is one of the few Defensive Power Shots that fail when the ball is too far away. Mario's taunt is him waving and saying, "Come on!"
 Mario has appeared occasionally in several trophy-earning cutscenes in  Mario Power Tennis . While Mario has appeared more than most characters in these cutscenes, Luigi appears in most trophy-earning cutscenes.
 In  Mario Tennis Open , Mario shares nearly identical stats from  Mario Power Tennis . Mario's metal form, Metal Mario, also appears as a Power character. Miis in the game can wear tennis clothing based on Mario, and if they win the singles Final Cup, they can wear his costume as well.
 In  Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash , Mario's tennis racket color is slightly different in this game; rather than being a solid blue, Mario's racket is predominantly red and blue with some white.
 In  Mario Tennis Aces , Mario by default wears a new tennis outfit. However, his standard outfit could be unlocked by either participating in the online tournament demo or accumulating 500 participation points in the January 2019 online tournament. Also, Mario was among the characters that could be played as in the online tournament demo. During the game's adventure mode, Mario is, for most of the missions, the playable character as the player must collect the five  Power Stones  to stop  Lucien . As of the game's version 2.0.0 update, the player can unlock a costume for Mario that has him wielding a Lucien replica while wearing his tennis outfit by completing  Last Trial Boss Challenge .
 
 Mario Clash 
   Mario in  Mario Clash 
 Mario shoots at Koopas and various other enemies in  Mario Clash , a game for the  Virtual Boy . Mario has to knock enemies away with  Koopa Shells  at the side. The game's gameplay is similar to the style of  Mario Bros. , but Luigi is absent.
 
 
 Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars 
   Mario's first 3D model 
 Mario appears as the main protagonist in  Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars . Mario first arrives to confront  Bowser , who has again captured  Princess Toadstool  (which by now is a recurring event). Mario battles Bowser atop a  Kinklink  and rescues Toadstool. Then a huge sword,  Exor , strikes the castle from atop and knocks them all to various spots in  Mario's world . Mario falls through the  pipe  on top of  his house  and lands on his bed.
 Mario discovers that the  Star Pieces  of the  wish -granting  Star Road  are being sought by a group called the  Smithy Gang , run by  Smithy , who are causing havoc throughout the world. On this adventure, Mario recruits  Mallow ,  Geno , Princess Toadstool, and even Bowser. They travel through much of the world, finding Star Pieces, which are protected by the Smithy Gang's strongest members. After all Star Pieces are collected, Mario fights Smithy. Mario reaches it through Bowser's Keep, which is inaccessible because Exor destroyed the bridge. With the help of Mallow's parents,  King  and  Queen Nimbus , Mario has passage through a special  cloud bus . When they finally arrive, Mario defeats Exor and goes to  Smithy's dimension  via Exor's mouth.
 Mario's journey is not over since Smithy has even more minions at his disposal. After many battles, Mario faces and defeats Smithy, saving the Star Road.
 
 Mario Party  series 
 “I've-a got it! The Stars will help us end their fight! We'll throw a Mario Party to fill the Star Bank!” 
 — Mario ,  Mario Party 6 
   Mario holding his Dice Block from  Super Mario Party 
 Mario is one of the playable characters in the  Mario Party  series, appearing in all games thus far along with  Luigi ,  Peach , and  Yoshi . He is always represented by his trademark red color. Mario can compete in  minigames  to win coins (or  Mini Stars , in  Mario Party 9  and in  Star-Crossed Skyway  in  Mario Party: Island Tour ), which ultimately can help him earn Stars. In the first three  Mario Party  games, Mario aims to become the superstar, the character with the most Stars, coins being the tiebreaker. Though Mario has no distinguishable traits from the other  Mario Party  characters, the most notable difference is Mario's ability to use the  Fireball Orb  in  Mario Party 7 . Additionally, Mario's default Duel Mode partner is  Koopa Troopa  in  Mario Party 3 , and the booklet says that his favorite item is the  Golden Mushroom , which increases the likelihood of his purchasing one if he is CPU-controlled. In  Mario Party 3 , he also challenges the player for the Courage  Star Stamp  if he is not used. Mario reappears in  Super Mario Party  as a playable character. Mario's  Dice Block  has one 1, three 3's, one 5, and one 6, making it very balanced.

 Battle entrance
 
 
 Mario jumps out of a  Warp Pipe  and exclaims, "Let's-a go!" 
 
 Mario has been playable in every  Super Smash Bros.  game to date. Mario is usually portrayed as a "main" character alongside  Link ,  Kirby , and  Pikachu , roughly depicted as the most prominent character and face of the games until  Ultimate , where he and Link share mascot status and Kirby is the closest thing to a main character in  World of Light . Mario has retained his balanced abilities even when fighting characters from other series. Due to his balanced playstyle, Mario's skill is reflected by the player, as mentioned by the Adventure mode Mario trophy. Also, as a result of his balanced design, Mario is also typically chosen for the "template" character; in  Super Smash Bros. , as well as all subsequent  Super Smash Bros.  installments, he is shown in the "How to Play" video; in  Super Smash Bros. Brawl , players use him when testing changes in Stage Creator; and in  Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS  /  Wii U , his silhouette is an opponent character for special move demonstrations. He is also used for controller mapping testing and is part of the gauge when players select the level of intensity in Classic Mode. Mario's moveset consists of quick short-ranged attacks, such as punches, kicks, and even head attacks. Mario's weight in  Super Smash Bros.  and  Super Smash Bros. Melee  is 100 units; starting from  Super Smash Bros. Brawl , his weight is decreased to 98 units. Mario's victory theme throughout the series, which is shared with the rest of the  Mario  characters (except  Rosalina ), is an arrangement of the level clear theme from  Super Mario Bros. 
 Mario's standard moveset is inspired from  Super Mario 64 ; his standard attack is the  Punch  + Punch +  Kick  combo, his dash attack is the  Slide Kick , his down smash is the  Sweep Kick  (until  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate ), and lastly, his back throw is the same throw he uses against  Bowser . Most of Mario's moveset remains the same throughout the games, though his forward smash has been altered from a fist-inflating punch to an explosive palm blast (used from  Super Smash Bros. Melee  onward). Additionally, his spinning kick forward aerial is replaced with a downward  hook  from  Melee  onward, while the Mario Tornado has been used as his down aerial since  Brawl .
 Mario's special moves are  Fireball , a bouncing fireball;  Cape , a cape swipe that reflects projectiles;  Super Jump Punch , which has him jump, causing coins to fly out when in contact with enemies; and  Mario Tornado , which has him spinning rapidly (since  Super Smash Bros. Brawl , it was replaced by  F.L.U.D.D. , a machine that sprays water, which can push opponents). His  Final Smash  is  Mario Finale , which consists of him unleashing a two-streamed blast of fire.
 In  Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS  /  Wii U , Mario, as any character, can use  equipment  to boost his stats at the cost of others. In addition to generic badges, Mario can wear certain additional equipment, including shoes (speed), overalls (defense), and gloves (attack). Finally, Mario can use alternate special moves, provided that these moves are found during normal gameplay. One exception, in the Nintendo 3DS version, is the Explosive Punch, which is unlocked only if the player has a combined score of 200,000 points in Target Blast and the third Challenge Panel has been revealed.
 Mario's alter-egos  Dr. Mario  and  Metal Mario  have also made appearances, with Dr. Mario being playable in  Super Smash Bros. Melee ,  Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS  /  Wii U , and  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate . Mario also made additional trophy and sticker appearances such as his Strikers incarnation, his Raccoon form, and him driving a vehicle.
 Like every other character previously playable in the series, Mario returns in  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  as a playable character. Mario appeared in the game's reveal teaser trailer, alongside Link (in his design from  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ) and new fighter  Inkling . Mario's fire-based attacks, such as his sweet-spotted forward smash, called Fireball, and Mario Finale, have brighter, flashier effects, including the appearance of smoke. Mario also has  Cappy  right alongside him, though he seems to be limited to aesthetic. Most of his moves are unaltered, though his Super Jump Punch now has a random chance of producing  regional coins  found in the  Metro Kingdom  from  Super Mario Odyssey . In addition, Mario's  Fire Mario  and  Wario -based costumes were replaced with the Wedding and Builder outfits from  Super Mario Odyssey . One of these two costumes, the Builder Outfit, was first used for Mario's artworks for  Super Mario Maker . In  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate , three more of Mario's standard attacks receive names: His up smash is the Lead Headbutt, his forward air is the Meteor Knuckle, and his back throw is the Airplane Swing. As with several other returning characters, the  Mario -series victory theme has been slightly shortened and sped up compared to in the previous installments.
 In  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate 's Adventure mode, Mario is seen when the fighters oppose  Galeem  for the first time. Although Mario is not shown to be hit by Galeem's beams directly, he, like every fighter except Kirby, is imprisoned in the World of Light, where a Galeem-serving Puppet Fighter (copy) of him is created. Mario is the first imprisoned fighter saved (being rescued following Kirby's defeat of the Mario puppet fighter), and once rescued, he joins Kirby against Galeem and later  Dharkon . In Mario's Classic Mode route, it is possible to unlock  Sonic ,  Bayonetta ,  Little Mac ,  Ike ,  Luigi ,  Roy , Dr. Mario, or  Olimar .
 Mario as he appears in  Mario Tennis Aces  is a  spirit  in  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate .

 In the beginning, a trophy of Mario and Kirby are thrown into an arena. The two come to life and fight. The player chooses the one to play with. If Mario is chosen, the opponent is Kirby. After the battle between the two, Mario resurrects Kirby. This scenario happens the other way around if the player chooses Kirby instead. The  Subspace Army  then ambushes the two.  Peach  and  Zelda  come to help, and they are all confronted by the  Ancient Minister . After seeing the two R.O.B.s setting up a  Subspace Bomb , Mario runs to try to stop it, only to be blasted away by  Petey Piranha . Afterwards, he meets  Pit  after the latter has descended from  Skyworld . They team up, reach land, and give chase to the Ancient Minister, but they lose him.
 Eventually, Mario sees Peach's trophy form apparently dissolving. Thinking Link and  Yoshi  have done this, Mario and Pit attack them, only to be defeated and stolen by  King Dedede . Kirby, however, saves them both, and Pit shoots an arrow at the  Cargo  that Dedede was driving, blowing its engine out. Keep note that this happens only if Peach was rescued from  Petey Piranha .
 If Zelda is rescued, Mario and Pit end up facing a  False Zelda , with Pit destroying her  Dark Cannon  that she was about to fire at Link and Yoshi. Link sees the Zelda trophy dissolve, and he and Yoshi attack Mario and Pit. Mario and Pit defeat them, but Mario sees the Peach trophy in the Cargo before Dedede takes Yoshi and Link. When Kirby saves them, Link is the one that blows out the engine.
 Regardless, Mario and his team chase Dedede through a cave and into his castle, only to find his throne room a mess and himself and the trophies he had nowhere to be found. They go through a secret passage and see Bowser trying to get away. Mario attacks, only to find that he has the princess not rescued from Petey Piranha. Pit fires an arrow, but Bowser dodges and the badge that the princess was wearing falls. Bowser gets away and Kirby eats the badge.
 Mario and his team encounter the Ancient Minister again later and chase him through  the Wilds , but the R.O.B.s stop them and detonate the Subspace Bomb that the Ancient Minister was carrying. Mario and his team escape and end up fighting the Subspace Army at  the Canyon , where they meet the  Ice Climbers ,  Marth ,  Lucas , the  PokÃ©mon Trainer , and  Ike . For the rest of the adventure, Mario fights with his increasing group until he and his allies defeat Tabuu and restore the world to normal.
 
 Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Classic Mode route 
 Mario's Classic Mode route has him fight many characters across different franchises and having no specific theme, similar to Classic Mode's previous iterations. However, Mario has a penultimate battle with Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings, while his final battle is against Bowser/Giga Bowser.

 Paper Mario  series 
 Paper Mario 
   Mario in his more "paper-like" form 
 Mario once again is invited to a party in Peach's Castle in  Paper Mario . Bowser interrupts, uprooting the castle and lifting it into the air. He and Kammy Koopa use the power of the  Star Rod  and defeat Mario. Bowser then tosses Mario out of the castle. Mario lands in a small forest located on the outskirts of  Goomba Village . Mario befriends Goombario, his first partner, and heads to  Toad Town  via  Goomba Road .
 Mario hears a  Star Spirit  called  Eldstar  asking for his help. The Star Spirit requests that he speak to him on  Shooting Star Summit , in which he has more strength to speak better. Once there, Mario meets many other Star Spirits asking for his help. He learns that Bowser has imprisoned them in special cards and has given them to his strongest minions. Mario then sets out on a quest in search of the Star Spirits. Mario makes many new friends and partners, eventually collecting all seven Star Spirits. Mario returns to Shooting Star Summit, where he gains access to  Star Way . Mario acquires a new ability called  Star Beam  and is transported to Bowser's Castle from  Star Haven . While Mario and his team are at Bowser's Castle, they save the many captives and fight Bowser at the top of the castle. 
 Bowser breaks the bridge Mario came from, ensuring that Mario cannot escape, and uses his Star Rod to fight. Mario, knowing the Star Rod's counter this time, uses Star Beam to weaken his power. The reluctant Bowser is unaffected by it and shakes the beam's power off. Watching the team's losing, Peach and  Twink  fight Kammy, who is responsible for creating the  Power Platform  that strengthens Bowser's Star Rod. They defeat Kammy and teach the  Peach Beam  while fully restoring Mario's party. Mario and company use the Peach Beam at Bowser to penetrate the Star Rod's shield, leaving him open to attack. Mario and his friends eventually defeat Bowser and once again save the Mushroom Kingdom. The castle returns to the ground from where it came, and another party is held there later while the power of wishes is restored. After a parade led by Luigi, Mario takes Peach to his house, where they watch the fireworks.
 During the events of this game,  Toad Town News  traces Mario as he tries to save the Star Spirits and posts news about his progress.
 
 Tattle 
 When Mario and his partner are battling a  Duplighost  (including  Lee ), it may transform into Goombario and use his tattle ability in battle.
 
 “It's Mario, silly! He's here to save Princess Peach, who was kidnapped by Bowser. Remember? He fights until the bitter end, no matter what enemies attack.” 
 — Duplighost ,  Paper Mario 
 Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door 
 "The Great Gonzales" redirects here. For information about the character from  Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door  sometimes called The Great Gonzales Jr., see  Mini-Yoshi .   
   Mario with a newer look compared to that of  Paper Mario 
 Peach invites Mario to  Rogueport  in  Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door  to share a  treasure map  leading to powerful artifacts called  Crystal Stars . By the time Mario arrives, the  X-Nauts  have kidnapped her. The X-Nauts need to use her as a vessel for the  Shadow Queen  so the leader of the X-Nauts,  Sir Grodus , can use her power to aid him in world domination.
 Mario meets  Professor Frankly , who tells him the history of Rogueport and reveals the secret of  the Thousand-Year Door . The Shadow Queen has once controlled Rogueport and trapped many of its citizens after Crystal Stars granted her power. The  Four Legendary Heroes  have used the power of the Crystal Stars against her and imprisoned her in the Thousand-Year Door for a millennium. After learning this story, Mario sets out to collect all seven Crystal Stars. Gaining many new partners and finding all Crystal Stars, Mario enters the Thousand-Year Door. There he finds Sir Grodus standing before the Shadow Queen's room. Mario defeats Sir Grodus but is then ambushed by Bowser and Kammy Koopa. This gives Grodus time to escape with Peach to the Shadow Queen's room. When Mario arrives, Grodus has awakened the Shadow Queen herself, taking control of Peach's body. Mario has to fight her possessed form, and using the help of the Rogueport citizens' wishes, Mario prevails.
 In the  Glitz Pit , Mario and his partner's team is named "The Great Gonzales" (in Japanese: ãããããã¡ã¾ã ããããã«ããã°ã¬ã¼ãã»ã´ã³ã¶ã¬ã¹) by  Grubba . Additionally in the Glitz Pit, when Mario optionally returns to the Glitz Pit to fight  Rawk Hawk  a second time, someone in the crowd yells, "Jumpman! Wait. Who?" referencing Mario's alternate name in  Donkey Kong  arcade materials.
 
 Super Paper Mario 
   Mario, with his companion  Pixl ,  Tippi 
 Mario and Luigi are once again called into action in  Super Paper Mario . Mario and Luigi sit in their house one day when they hear the news that Princess Peach has been kidnapped. The Mario Bros. rush to Bowser's Castle, thinking he has the princess, an assumption to be proven wrong. Later, a new antagonist named  Count Bleck  shows up and kidnaps Luigi and Bowser. It is also revealed that Count Bleck has Princess Peach, too.
 Mario is transported to  Flipside , a town between dimensions. Mario later finds Bowser and Princess Peach, who decide to join Mario in his quest to stop Count Bleck. Mario must go through eight chapters to get eight  Pure Hearts , which can counter the Chaos Heart. Mario also encounters new enemies, such as  O'Chunks ,  Dimentio ,  Mimi ,  Nastasia , and even his brother, Luigi, now called  Mr. L  because Nastasia, an assistant of Count Bleck, has brainwashed him (however, he joins Mario once he is freed by Dimentio and sent to  the Underwhere ).
 After collecting the eight Pure Hearts, Mario, Princess Peach, Bowser, Luigi, and some  Pixls  face Count Bleck. After Bleck is defeated, Dimentio, a former minion of Bleck, betrays Bleck and teleports him to  Dimension D  to deal with him later. Then Dimentio, the  Chaos Heart , and Luigi merge together to form  Super Dimentio  as the final boss. After Mario has defeated Super Dimentio, Count Bleck and  Tippi  get married to stop  the Void . Mario is mentioned to be the first of the Heroes of Light.

 In the fourth installment of the  Paper Mario  series,  Paper Mario: Sticker Star , Mario, along with Princess Peach and many  Toads , is celebrating Sticker Fest, a holiday where six  Royal Stickers  ride in on a  comet  that allows wishes to come true. Bowser, however, takes the comet for himself, releasing its Royal Stickers to him and his minions. Mario attempts to jump on him, but his efforts fail and Mario is knocked out. Shortly after waking up, he meets a sticker guardian named  Kersti , and with her help, he saves some Toads hidden around the town and takes back the Royal Stickers. Mario then pursues Bowser by traveling through various worlds. Along the way, Mario must collect various stickers to aid him in defeating enemies and progress through levels.
 After getting five of the six Royal Stickers, Mario is allowed to enter  Bowser's Sky Castle . Bowser is defeated by Mario, and he gets the last Royal Sticker, but Kersti is destroyed in the process. He releases Peach, who thanks Mario for his efforts and allows him to make a wish on the Sticker Star. He wishes for the return of Kersti, and the Sticker Fest is saved.

 After getting all six Big Paint Stars, Mario is ready to face Bowser by entering Black Bowser's Castle, but he cannot walk up the rainbow road path. Luigi comes in with his kart, and the duo drives off to face Bowser. Mario and Huey defeat Bowser and paints Peach back, and she thanks Mario for his efforts. They leave the castle, but Huey decides to stay behind to drain the castle and sends the black paint far away. That night, a celebration is held for the return of all of the colors in Prism Island. Peach thanks Mario for everything and realizes that Huey will be all right after everything they have done.

Mario quickly notices Peach's change of appearance and demeanor, the result of her being attacked by  King Olly , and is nearly turned into Origami himself before barely escaping the castle. It now falls on him to restore the Mushroom Kingdom with the help of numerous allies, including several of Bowser's minions and even Bowser himself.
 
 
 Luigi's Mansion  series 
 Luigi's Mansion 
   Mario trapped in the portrait 
 Mario plays his third role as a captive during the events of  Luigi's Mansion . Mario visits a mansion that Luigi has mysteriously won. There,  King Boo  overpowers Mario with his many Boos and imprisons him within a portrait. King Boo is apparently mad at Mario for harassing his kind during his past adventures. Luigi comes later to discover why his brother did not come back. Luigi overcomes his cowardice and captures all Boos by using his  Poltergust 3000 . After defeating King Boo, Luigi takes Mario's portrait and reverts him to his original form by using  Professor Elvin Gadd 's  Ghost Portrificationizer  in reverse. Mario is left dizzy in the picture frame while Luigi laughs at him.
 
 Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon 
 While Mario reappears in  Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon , he plays a relatively minor role in the game. Prior to the final boss battle, Mario is found trapped as a sketch in a painting again. Mario is not directly referenced or seen until in  Haunted Towers , where Luigi sees the Boos holding an upside-down portrait of his being trapped. There, only his feet are showing. Later, King Boo reveals that he trapped him and engages Luigi in battle. After King Boo is defeated, Luigi frees Mario with his  Dark-Light Device , after which he, Mario, E. Gadd, several ghosts, and several Toads pose for a picture. Before the picture is taken, Mario is shown to be proud of Luigi for facing his fears to rescue him, congratulating him and putting his hand on his brother's shoulder.

Mario is very happy that Luigi saved him, and jumps in his arms to hug him, then he immediately leads Luigi to Princess Peach for her to be freed too. However, King Boo traps everyone besides Luigi (who was shoved out of the way by  Polterpup ) in a single painting. After Luigi defeats King Boo, Mario and everyone else are freed again, and they all work together to rebuild the hotel, which collapsed after the battle. Afterwards, Mario and the others leave to return home.

 Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga  /  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions 
   Mario's artwork from  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga 
 Mario ventures with Luigi through the  Beanbean Kingdom  in  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga  to stop  Cackletta  from taking over the Beanbean Kingdom.
 An ambassador from the Beanbean Kingdom visits  Princess Peach . However, the ambassador is actually Cackletta in disguise, and she steals Princess Peach's voice during the visit. Toad runs to  Mario's house , warning him about Princess Peach's voice dilemma. Mario comes out of his shower and gets dressed before rushing to the castle, dragging Luigi along by the clothesline rope. There, Mario fights Bowser, but Peach speaks and interrupts their fight. As she speaks, explosives drop from her mouth and shake the castle. Bowser, outraged that another villain has stolen his spotlight, suggests that Mario go to the Beanbean Kingdom with his  Koopa Cruiser . Mario gets a suitcase and 100 coins from Toadsworth before boarding the airship. Luigi ends up coming along against his will when Bowser mistakenly believes he wants to join his crew.
 As they near the Beanbean Kingdom, Cackletta's apprentice,  Fawful , causes the Koopa Cruiser to crash, causing Mario and Luigi to land on the  Beanbean Borderlands . They find Bowser stuck in a cannon, but conflict with the sleazy  Tolstar  causes him to be blasted away. In the meantime, Mario and Luigi rescue  Prince Peasley  from Cackletta's spell in  Hoohoo Mountain , and the prince grants passage to the  Beanbean Castle . At the Beanbean Castle, however, Mario and Luigi are tricked into disabling the castle's security, allowing Cackletta and Fawful to steal the Beanstar. To make matters worse,  Queen Bean  has been infected with a  Belly Blech  worm, and Mario and Luigi must retrieve the  Chuckola Reserve  at the  Chateau de Chucklehuck  for her to recover. They find competition with the self-proclaimed master thief  Popple  and his sidekick,  Rookie , really an amnesiac Bowser. Once Queen Bean is healed, they learn that the Beanstar can grant any wish when awakened by a pure voice, which is why Cackletta had stolen Princess Peach's voice, and of her invasion in  Woohoo Hooniversity . Mario and Luigi confront Cackletta and Fawful, who attempt to use  Peach-bots  to awaken the Beanstar, but they only enrage it. After Mario and Luigi defeat Cackletta, Prince Peasley knocks Fawful and Cackletta's life essence away. When the two attempt to retrieve the Beanstar, they fight Popple and Rookie, although a partially functioning Peach-bot enrages the Beanstar once more. With Mario, Luigi, Popple, and Rookie hanging on (while Rookie realizes his true identity), they blast away from Woohoo Hooniversity, but the Beanstar shatters into four pieces. Mario and Luigi crash-land at  Oho Oasis , but they make their way back to the Beanbean mainland after Prince Peasley informs them of Peach's presence at the  Beanbean International Airport .
 Mario and Luigi arrive at the Beanbean International Airport, expecting Princess Peach. Clearing the airport of a few  Piranhas , the  Toad Express  lands on the runway. Mario and Luigi are surprised to see Princess Peach talking in her normal voice. It is explained to them that Peach's voice was never stolen in the first place, as Prince Peasley had warned her beforehand, and the Peach that has her voice stolen is a  decoy . With events now taken a peaceful turn, Princess Peach requests to go to  Little Fungitown , and the brothers escort her through  Teehee Valley . Arriving in town, Mario contracts  Bean Fever  after consuming an  Invincishroom  (which actually turns out to be a  Poison Mushroom  in the remake) from winning at the arcade. While Luigi is about finding the cure, Peach is abducted by  Bowletta , Cackletta possessing Bowser as Fawful had inserted Cackletta's life essence into the Koopa King after their defeats at Woohoo Hooniversity. At the Beanbean Castle, Mario and Luigi hear from Bowletta's ransom, demanding the Beanstar in exchange for Peach. Mario and Luigi then travel to find the four scattered Beanstar Pieces in  Gwarhar Lagoon , from  Harhall , at the  Yoshi Theater , and at the  Winkle Colosseum . After receiving all four pieces, they return to the castle, where Bowletta again sends a message to deliver the restored Beanstar to  Joke's End  to begin the exchange. But the brothers and their allies have suspicions that Bowletta may not follow through on her end of the bargain, taking a false Beanstar with them. At Joke's End, Fawful sees through their ruse and takes the real Beanstar, but Peach is saved by disguising Luigi as her, fooling Bowletta into believing the real princess is an imposter. Bowletta discovers the deception in the somehow-repaired Koopa Cruiser, but Luigi manages to escape safely while taking back the Beanstar.
 As a backup plan, Bowletta takes over Bowser's Castle and attacks the  Beanbean Castle Town . Mario and Luigi ask  Blanbladon  to take them to Bowser's Castle for a final showdown. After defeating the seven  Koopalings  and eventually Fawful, they confront and seemingly defeat Bowletta at the throne room, but she pulls a sneak attack and sucks them into her body, where they have to fight  Cackletta's Spirit . Mario and Luigi finally destroy Cackletta and her spirit and escape from the castle (which Peasley set to explode) in time. With the Beanbean Kingdom saved, Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toadsworth return to the Mushroom Kingdom along with Bowser, who is back to normal and survived his castle's explosion thanks to Peasley.

 Mario and his brother, Luigi, travel back in time in  Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time . 
 Mario and Luigi are at Peach's Castle, watching Princess Peach go to the past using Professor E. Gadd's  Time Machine  powered by the  Cobalt Star . Toadsworth, filled with worry, collapses from  Shroomshock , and Mario goes to retrieve a Refreshshroom from his quarters to cure him. Afterwards, the Time Machine returns but without Princess Peach. Instead, a  Junior Shrooboid  is inside and attacks, but Mario manages to beat it. Afterwards, a  Time Hole  appears in the center court of the castle. Luigi looks at it in awe from the rim, when Toadsworth comes and accidentally knocks him into the Time Hole. Mario enters it to save his brother, and they travel back in time. They land on the starting road to  Hollijolli Village , before  Stuffwell , a living mechanical suitcase created by E. Gadd, emerges behind them to act as their assistant. They fight more and more enemies. They see the village damaged and ruined by many  Shroobs  and  Shroob UFOs . They then get assaulted and nearly defeated by a wave of Shroobs and Shroob UFOs. Meanwhile, Baby Mario and  Baby Luigi  rescue them by defeating the remaining Shroob foes.
 Baby Bowser  helps them to escape from  Baby Peach 's incessant crying. They board his Koopa Cruiser and crash-land into Bowser's Castle as a result of the Shroob UFOs' aerial attacks. Mario and Luigi look for their younger selves and team up, finding a piece of the Cobalt Star along the way. In Baby Bowser's room, a Time Hole is located, and the four Mario Bros. head back to Peach's Castle of the present with Baby Peach and the younger Toadsworth following behind them. They meet up with Professor E. Gadd, who advises them to find the other Cobalt Star Shards in the past when Junior Shrooboid has a reaction to it.
 Mario and the others go through the new Time Holes that appear around the castle. They meet  Toadiko  and  Toadbert , the Toads who went with Princess Peach and give them information about the Shroobs and their leader,  Princess Shroob . They finally collect five Cobalt Star Shards, break the barrier of the  Shroob Castle  (previously Peach's Castle), and locate Peach. After Mario and the others down the  Shroob Mother Ship  and defeat Princess Shroob, Peach refuses to let Mario and Luigi reassemble the Cobalt Star with the centerpiece in her possession. But Baby Bowser takes it and fixes the star, causing the  Elder Princess Shroob  imprisoned by Peach to be freed. The Mario Bros. prevail and discover that the babies' tears can revert all of the  shroobified  people to normal. Thus, E. Gadd rains a similar liquid across the kingdom, ridding the Mushroom Kingdom of the extraterrestrial invaders. The baby Mario Bros., Baby Peach, and young Toadsworth return to the past, bidding farewell to their future counterparts.
 
 Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  /  Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey 
   Mario and Luigi with Starlow 
 Mario and Luigi appear again in  Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story . 
 A new disease called the  blorbs , which make Toads grow to a giant size, has affected the Mushroom Kindgom citizens. Mario and Luigi attend a meeting at Peach's Castle that is disrupted when Bowser barges in. Bowser then fights Mario and is defeated. Thrown to  Dimble Wood , Bowser receives a  Vacuum Mushroom  from  Fawful , which makes him inhale everything, including Mario, Luigi,  Starlow , the princess, Toadsworth, and several of the Toads.
 Mario and Luigi reunite inside Bowser, who is knocked out in  Cavi Cape . The brothers and Starlow help Bowser get his castle back from Fawful. Along the way, Bowser meets  Broque Monsieur  and  Broggy  and gets the ability of the Vacuum Block, which allows the brothers to aid Bowser in his fights. Mario, Luigi, and Starlow help Bowser in his trips, while they travel to various parts of his body. When Bowser finally reaches his castle and reclaims it, Bowser is grown fat from eating high-calorie foods from the  Boos  after winning the fight against  Midbus , Fawful's minion.
 While Bowser is fat, Mario and Luigi find Peach in the  Flab Zone , who is attacked and kidnapped in front of them by  Kretin . After a long chase, Mario and Luigi trap and defeat Alpha and Beta Kretin, freeing the princess. When Fawful is attempting to extract Peach from Bowser, she tells them that Fawful probably wants the  Dark Star , so he can control the Mushroom Kingdom. Peach also explains that she herself is necessary for this process as she is the one who can awaken it. As they get to the end of the Flab Zone, Peach is taken out of Bowser's body by Fawful and is once again kidnapped. Meanwhile, Midbus gives Bowser a treadmill to lose his extra pounds on. 
 As the rest of the adventure slides, Mario and Luigi travel to find the  Star Cures  to destroy the blockade in Peach's Castle. At one point during the adventure, however, Mario gets captured by a group of  Sockops , forcing Luigi to rescue him alone. After fighting Junker in  Peach's Castle Garden , they go back into Bowser and wake him up from his back pain. After going through the castle, they all find the Dark Star awakening and Fawful becoming Dark Fawful, who is sent flying by Bowser. The Dark Star enters Bowser, and it copies his DNA, but is incomplete thanks to the Mario Bros., and combines with  Dark Fawful  to create  Dark Bowser .
 After Mario and Luigi defeat Dark Star Core and Bowser defeats Dark Bowser, Fawful explodes, destroying himself and expelling everyone else from Bowser's body, freeing them. Realizing that Mario was inside him all along, an enraged Bowser charges into battle against Mario and Luigi, which ends the story. At the end, it is revealed that Mario and Luigi win yet again and Bowser is back at his ruined castle, recovering from the injuries he sustained in their fight. However, they and Peach send him a  cake  as thanks for him inadvertently saving the kingdom.
 In the  3DS remake , Mario makes a brief appearance in the new  Bowser Jr.'s Journey  mode, where he and Luigi pass by Bowser Jr., who picks a fight with them while in  Bubble Lake . Starlow stops them from fighting, however, reminding them that there is no time for this, even for Bowser Jr. In the story timeline, this event happens while searching for the Star Cures, making it a mishap if they were looking for the third Star Cure because Junior sees his father (who would be trapped in a safe) as a giant later in Bubble Lake.

Despite this, they overcome the enemies and build Papercraft Peach that defeats Papercraft Bowser Jr. However, the Bowser Jrs. escape with the princesses and the book unharmed. They leave a Red Medallion behind, which opens the door to the  Twinsy Tropics Dungeon , but the trio must travel through Doop Doop Dunes again. Before leaving the dunes, they have to face the Chargin' Chuck Corps, who arrested them earlier. After this, they battle with two of the Koopalings before reaching Bowser's Castle. At Bowser's Castle, they find the Kamek duo and the new Papercraft King Boo. Toadette arrives with Papercraft Yoshi, who defeats Papercraft King Boo. This time, however, Kamek kidnaps Toadette to prevent more Papercrafts from being built. Kamek then plans to build his own Papercraft Bowser with the help of his paper form. A  Fly Guy  helps the trio rescue Toadette, and the trio encounters the Bowser Jrs. on guard duty.
 The princesses escape and greet the team but are caught by Bowser Jr. Before fighting, however, they realize they forgot to hide the book and then flee. The trio catches them, and they receive a fake book, which fools the trio, allowing the princesses to be recaptured. Despite this, the trio defeats them and rescues the princesses. In retaliation, the  Koopa Troop  blows up Peach's Castle. The princesses return to the castle, and the trio continues to fight Paper Bowser, knowing the princesses are safe. Toadette realizes they can build a staircase to the top of Mount Brrr, where the newly built  Neo Bowser Castle  is located. They travel through Gloomy Woods once again but end up on the haunted side. Both Marios are kidnapped by Boos, leaving Luigi alone to find them. Once Luigi has defeated  King Boo  and rescued them, they meet Toadette and the remaining Paper Toads at Mount Brrr. The Toads build a staircase, and the trio climbs to the castle.  Iggy  signals the rest of the Koopalings that the team has arrived. They encounter  Nabbit  and help him collect the coins around the area. Nabbit rewards them with the remaining  Bros. Attacks . They find Toadette, who is defending the Papercraft creations, but the Kamek duo unleashes Papercraft Bowser, who burns all the Papercraft.

The Koopalings try to retaliate and set a timer to blow up any remains of Peach's Castle, but the Mario Bros. stop the timer. The trio faces the Kamek duo and the Koopalings and promptly defeat them. When they finally reach Bowser and his paper counterpart, the Bowsers merge and form  Shiny RoboBowser . However, the Mario Bros. defeat the new boss and trap Paper Bowser inside the  Paper Mario  book, and Bowser falls to the bottom of Mount Brrr.
 The team returns to the reassembled Peach's Castle. Princess Peach and her paper counterpart congratulate the team for banishing Paper Bowser, and Toadette leads a Papercraft parade in the credits.

 Mario vs. Donkey Kong  series 
 The  Mario vs. Donkey Kong  series revisits the old  Donkey Kong  series, pitting Mario against a misbehaving  Donkey Kong . The original  Mario vs. Donkey Kong  game, released in 2004, gave Mario the same moveset as 1994's  Donkey Kong  for the Game Boy and introduced the windup toys known as  Mini Marios . The Mini Marios replaced Mario as the playable character in the later subsequent games,  Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis ,  Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again! ,  Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem! , and  Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move , although Mario is still present in the storylines, as is  Pauline .

 Eventually, Mario reaches the top of the building, where he finds Pauline in a room with one window. As they are about to hug, Donkey Kong flips the light switch off, grabs Pauline, and leaps out the window, with Mario and the minis following him.
 After much more toil, Mario once again enters the room, where he finds DK, Pauline, two Toads (one blue and one green), and two Mini Marios. As Mario is confused, Pauline reveals that the entire adventure was to test the Mini Mario product, and the group decides to celebrate.

When he learns from Mario that the toys are out of stock, he goes into yet another fit of rage, capturing Pauline. Mario once again must rely on his minis to help get Pauline back.
 After much journeying, Mario defeats DK and tries to hug Pauline, but Donkey Kong captures her again, leaving Mario to chase after him again.

One of the Music Keys is found in the sea, another one in  Wario's Carnival , and another in  Freeze Mountain . Toad, who sees this occur, rushes to tell Mario (or Luigi). If all keys are not returned, they can be exploited by anyone.
 Mario responds by setting out to find all four Music Keys, along with Toad. Using his  SS Brass  to navigate, Mario challenges the key owners to dance-offs. Mario then faces Waluigi (and other enemies) to dance-offs and gets all four Music Keys back. After Mario wins the keys, however, Bowser steals them. Bowser then goes to his castle, and Mario follows him with the SS Brass. Mario performs the "Final Dance Off" with him and gets the Music Keys back. Bowser reveals his intentions of stealing the keys: to help cure his tone-deafness. Mario and Toad decide to use the keys to change Bowser's Castle and the surrounding area into a paradise. From this, though, some music has been implemented into their souls, so they cannot stop dancing. These keys then are all returned to the Truffle Towers.

 Cultural impact

 General information 
 Physical description 
   
 Mario's appearance from the Nintendo 64 era (left) and his current appearance (right)
 
   
 Mario's initial appearances in the cabinet art (left) and in the poster art (right) for  Donkey Kong 
 
 Mario's distinctive look is due to technology restrictions in the mid-1980s. With a limited number of pixels and colors, the game developers, including Mario's creator,  Shigeru Miyamoto , could not animate Mario's movement without making his arms "disappear" if his shirt was a solid color, so they gave Mario overalls. The developers additionally did not have the space to give him a mouth, the result of Mario's mustache. Finally, they used a cap to bypass the problem of animating and drawing hair.
 Mario has undergone major changes since his initial appearance in  Donkey Kong  up until  Super Mario Bros.  Although he has the general features such as the clothing and the mustache, it is not until  Super Mario Bros.  where he resembles as he is today. In  Donkey Kong , Mario appears lankier with a more realistic-looking red nose and a cleft chin. In some portrayals in  Donkey Kong Jr. , however, he appears stouter with a round nose, which resembles more closely to Mario's current design, although some promotional art retains Mario's original  Donkey Kong  design. The stubbier design is retained in  Mario Bros. , with a few changes.
 Since  Super Mario Bros. , however, Mario is depicted as a stocky young man who wears a trademark cap, a long-sleeved red shirt, blue overalls with two yellow buttons, brown shoes, and white gloves, with a large round face, a big round nose, clear and slightly tanned skin, chocolate brown hair (although the DiC cartoons sometimes depict it as black like his mustache) with three locks on the front, just above his forehead, four back locks that cover the back of his neck and a small sprout-like tuft on the top of his head, and a black mustache (sometimes brown like his hair). His neck is very short, to the point that both in artwork and in gameplay outside the  Super Smash Bros.  series, it is very rarely visible due to Mario's large head and the position of his chin. Though he was originally imagined as middle-aged, his age has been approximated to be about 26 years old, [22]  while Shigeru Miyamoto later placed it at either 24 or 25. [23]  The  Mario vs. Wario  comic also implies Mario (and Wario) is roughly in his late 20s or early 30s, as he recalls his childhood 20 years ago.
 While Mario is consistently portrayed as a short character, his precise height and proportions vary across media. According to the height of his life-size figure, he is 150 cm (4 ft 11 in.) tall, [24]  though other life-size merchandise depict Mario as shorter at 122 cm (4 ft) tall. [ citation needed ]  Crossover artwork featuring Mario and  Sonic the Hedgehog  (who stands at 1 m / 3 ft 3 in.) shows Mario at around the same height as him, if not two or three inches shorter due to Sonic's quills. Mario's height relationship with other humans has been varied. Some media, such as  Super Mario Odyssey  and  Mario's Time Machine , show Mario as much shorter than a realistic human, while others, including  Mario Golf , the cartoons, and  Super Smash Bros. , show Mario's height closer relative to other humans.
 Merchandise for the original  Donkey Kong  showed Mario as balding, although most media depict Mario with a full set of hair. The most notable change Mario has received over the years since  Super Mario Bros.  (omitting stylistic variations such as depictions in  Paper Mario ) is his change in stature; Mario is shown to be much stubbier in his earlier appearances compared to his more recent appearances, starting with  Super Mario 64 . Mario's legs and arms have grown longer over the years, giving him a slimmer look. This may have been the result of Shigeru Miyamoto's response to their "cute" appearances, who considered redesigning them to "become a bit more grown-up" in the  GameCube  eraâfor instance, by removing their trademark  V sign . [25] 
 
   
 Mario's design differences from  Paper Mario  to his current appearance since  Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door 
 
 Mario from his  Super Mario 64  appearance is depicted with darker blue overalls and bigger eyes than in his current appearance based on the one in  Luigi's Mansion . He has a slightly darker skin, and his ears are also rounder. His overall straps are longer, and his cap is less round. Mario is overall less defined in the game artworks of the time due to the older software used to design him, especially noticeable in his hair, which appears reddish instead of chocolate brown and with a similar shape of his hat. The differences in Mario's 3D art over time, as a result, is more pronounced than the differences in Mario's 2D art since  Super Mario Bros.  Ever since  Luigi's Mansion , however, Mario has received only minor changes to his general appearance, such as longer limbs, an increased height, a clearer and slightly tanned skin tone, brighter colors, and added detail in his shoes, eyes, and cap emblem in most game artworks since  Super Mario 3D World , though in the Wii U and Switch generations, Mario's irises have been slightly thicker.
 Mario has a few stylistic variations across some games, sometimes within series. One variation is Mario's overall appearance in the  Paper Mario  games: it is generally the same, with black dots for eyes and no eyebrows, although he has a shorter stature. Since  Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door , however, Mario's body is more simplistic, with legless feet, a rounder face, and a full outline around the arms. In addition, starting with  Paper Mario: Sticker Star , all of Mario's paper appearances have depicted him with a white outline around his entire body. Another variation is Mario's depiction in the  Mario & Luigi  games, although it is more subtle, where Mario is given black eyes rather than blue. 
 The  Super Smash Bros.  series also has Mario's appearance change between games. In  Super Smash Bros.  for Nintendo 64, Mario's appearance is derived from  Super Mario 64  but with minor alterations, such as a slimmer appearance. In  Super Smash Bros. Melee , Mario's design incorporates elements from  Mario Kart 64 , as well as official artwork from the Nintendo 64 era, which is evidenced by his tanned complexion. Mario's hair and clothing have more detail in them, with his overalls particularly sporting back pockets and having denim textures. In  Super Smash Bros. Brawl , Mario's back pockets return, but his overall design is updated to resemble his appearances in  Super Mario Sunshine  and later games. However, Mario's color scheme is darker than before, while his hair and clothing have more-realistic detailing. In  Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS  /  Wii U , Mario's design is slimmer and more vibrant, matching his appearances in games like  Super Mario 3D Land ,  Mario Kart 7 ,  Super Mario 3D World , and  Mario Kart 8 . As an accompaniment, Mario's hair and clothing have much less detailing. In  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate , Mario's design is mostly the same, aside from a more subdued color scheme and simple detailing in his hair and clothing, but not to the same extent as  Melee  and  Brawl .
 
 
 Clothing 
   Mario wearing his trademark outfit consisting of a red shirt, a red cap, blue overalls with yellow buttons, white gloves, and brown shoes 
 Mario is typically shown wearing his trademark outfit wherever he goes. He has a long-sleeved red shirt (short-sleeved in  Super Mario Sunshine ), which is tucked under a pair of white gloves and has a noticeable collar at the neck. Layered over the shirt is a pair of blue overalls with yellow buttons. On his feet is a pair of light brown work shoes. In the  Paper Mario  series, these are known as boots and it is shown to have a rim on the top, although Mario's shoes in most media do not have this rim.
 Originally, Mario wore red overalls on top of a blue shirtânearly the opposite colors of what he wears now. The Famicom version of  Mario Bros.  is the first game to depict Mario with blue overalls and a red undershirt (although on the box art, he is depicted entirely in blue), but  Super Mario Bros. 2  standardized Mario's current colors.
 Mario's trademark is his red cap with his red "M" insignia. Mario's cap is sometimes an important and even mandatory accessory in some games, such as  Super Mario 64 , where he takes more damage without his cap. In  Super Mario Sunshine , if Mario loses his cap, he acquires damage over time from the heat of the sun. In most media, however, Mario's cap is treated as a mere accessory, and Mario can go capless in some games without any additional effect, such as in  New Super Mario Bros. Wii . In some games, such as  Super Mario 3D Land , if Mario is in  small form , he is seen without his cap, although it is no different from the other incarnations of the small form. In  Super Mario Odyssey , Mario's default cap is replaced with  Cappy , which can be replaced with other hats in the  Crazy Cap  stores as well. Additionally, Mario has over 40 outfits available to wear, which can range from recolors to resemble  Luigi ,  Wario , or  Waluigi  to unique outfits that see Mario dressed as a pirate, astronaut, knight, or musician, or even naked with only his hat and a pair of polka dot boxers. In  Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 , Mario wears different outfits depending on the sport or activity being played.
 Mario has seen some variations to his outfit in the games. In  Super Mario Sunshine , for instance, Mario has shorter sleeves. In addition, Mario can wear a tropical shirt over his normal shirt, along with sunglasses that darken the screen, if he talks to the  Sunglasses vendor . Mario also usually gains alternate outfits when using power-ups, from simple recolors to covering his whole body, such as  Fire Mario ,  Tanooki Mario ,  Propeller Mario ,  Flying Squirrel Mario , and  Cat Mario . Finally, Mario can resemble different characters, even outside the  Mario  series, by using a  Mystery Mushroom  to change into one of the various forms of Costume Mario in  Super Mario Maker . 
 Although mostly seen with his default plumber attire, Mario has also worn several alternate outfits in the spin-off games, including but not limited to  Dr. Mario , the  Mario Strikers  games,  Mario's Picross , and  NES Open Tournament Golf .
 Within the  Super Smash Bros.  series, Mario has a total of eight different costumes to choose from in battle (five in the original  Super Smash Bros.  and  Super Smash Bros. Melee , six in  Super Smash Bros. Brawl , and eight in  Super Smash Bros. for 3DS  /  Wii U  and  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate ). Mario's first alternate costume consists of red overalls and a blue cap and undershirt, being a reversal of his current color scheme, which was previously used in the DIC Entertainment  Mario  cartoons. Mario's second alternate costume consists of tiger-orange overalls and a green cap and undershirt, resembling his appearance on the Japanese box art for  Wrecking Crew , as well as Luigi's in-game appearance from the arcade version of  Mario Bros.  (but with swapped colors). Mario's third alternate costume consists of brown overalls and cap, with a white undershirt, being inspired by  Foreman Spike . Mario's fourth alternate costume consists of purple overalls and a yellow undershirt and cap, being derived from Wario's appearance. In  Brawl , Mario gains a fifth alternate costume in the form of red overalls and a white cap and undershirt, derived from Fire Mario's current colors. In  3DS  /  Wii U , Mario's reversed red and blue costume is replaced by one with a pink undershirt and cyan overalls and cap, derived from his appearance on the Japanese box art of  Mario Bros. ; he also gains a costume with dark indigo overalls and a purple undershirt and cap, based on Waluigi; lastly, Mario gains a seventh alternate costume in the form of red-and-white striped overalls and cap, and a blue undershirt with white stars, based on his appearance in  NES Open Tournament Golf . In  Ultimate , Mario's Fire Mario and Wario costumes are replaced with his Builder and Wedding outfits from  Super Mario Odyssey .
 
 Name 
 Mario's family name is given as "Mario" in  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  and made popular in the live-action  Super Mario Bros.  movie. This occasionally occurs in other mediaâfor instance, the  Prima  guidebook for  Mario Party 2  lists his name as Mario Mario in a note section, [26]  and the Prima guide for  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga  similarly shows Mario's full name as Mario Mario in the list of major characters. [27]  Also, when people asked Mario (voiced by Charles Martinet) what his last name was at  San Diego Comic-Con  2012, he had responded with this:  "What's my last name? Ah, that's a very good question! ...That's right! It's-a Mario. My name-a Mario Mario. Of course, my brother name, a-Luigi Mario. And of course, my mama's-a Mama Mia Mario; my papa Papa Pio Mario. Of course, my grandmama Grandmama Mia Mario, and my grandpapa Grandpaâet cetera, et cetera. Yeah, first name Mario, last name-a Mario. Yahoo!" [28]  However, Nintendo of America earlier claimed that "there are no last names." [29]  This was later stated by Nintendo president  Satoru Iwata . [3]  Additionally, Shigeru Miyamoto has previously stated that Mario and Luigi do not have last names "just like Mickey Mouse" contrary to their depiction in the movie, although he has later redacted that stance, confirming at the  Super Mario Bros.  30th Anniversary  festival in September 2015 that Mario's and Luigi's last names are indeed "Mario." [1] 
 
 Personality 
   Mario rescues Luigi after a badly ending sibling rivalry, until he is distracted. 
 Mario is known for being kind, cheerful, playful, courageous, and headstrong and is also eager and cocky in certain occasions. Officially, however, Nintendo producers have stated that Mario's biography is kept simple in order to make the character versatile and reusable in many different games and situations. [ citation needed ]  As such, Mario is considered one of the most underdeveloped characters in the  Mario  series; in contrast, his brother,  Luigi , has gained more of a personality over the years. In most media and some games, though, Mario is depicted as an Italian plumber from Brooklyn [30]  who stands for what is right and has a love for Italian food. Mario has proven himself to be a competent fighter, all-around sports player, and party lover in  Mario  spin-off titles.
 Mario shows generally good sportsmanship, even complimenting his opponents, as shown in instances like  Mario Kart 8  and  Fortune Street , as well as smiling if he loses in  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate . However, in other spin-offs, he is usually sad after a loss and sometimes sobs. For example, in  Mario Kart 64 , if he does not place on the podium, he is shown wiping a tear. In  Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour , if he attains a Double Bogey, he throws a small fit. Finally, it has been said that Mario loves animals, especially the most unusual ones, [31]  and he also enjoys music, particularly opera or new-wave Europop, [31]  although there is no further comment for these statements.  Mario Strikers Charged  gives Mario a rock-n'-roll theme for his entrance and scoring animations and an orchestrated theme for his Super Ability. It is revealed that Mario can play the piano, guitar, synthesizer, timpani, xylophone, saxophone, and trumpet.
 Mario has been shown on various occasions to have an almost overbearing attitude towards his brother, as displayed by certain cutscenes in  Mario Power Tennis ; this is shown most often in  Super Mario-Kun . However, this could also just be Mario's outgoing "big brother" personality interacting with Luigi's more introverted nature. Additionally, Mario is much more impulsive and aggressive than his brother, Luigi, and is willing to enter dangerous situations all alone. In  Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars ,  Mallow  even had to physically restrain Mario from brawling several times, such as before the battle with  Bowyer , so that the heroes could figure out what exactly was happening to their world.
 Mario has occasionally shown aggressive or vulgar tendencies throughout his appearances, albeit in a lighthearted and comic-relief manner; a notable exception is in  Super Mario MomotarÅ , when Mario is shown holding a gun and aiming at Bowser, albeit to intimidate him. In  Super Mario-Kun , Mario is short-tempered and resorts to yelling at his friends for failing or taking uncalled-for actions; Mario himself is not above certain vulgar actions, such as farting to taunt his opponents or urinating on Yoshi, and he also cross-dresses several times. The title itself and the art style of the  Super Mario-Kun  manga also depict Mario with a childish personality. "Kun" is a generally masculine Japanese honorific for juniors such as boys or teenagers.
 In a virtual magazine for the Japan-exclusive  Satellaview , his vulgar and aggressive tendencies are exaggerated for the purpose of adult-oriented humor. Mario is shown smoking a cigarette and abusing his friends and love interest; he abuses Toad in particular often due to the latter's own perverse behavior in the magazine (or else for no reason at all), stomps on both Toad and Peach repeatedly for having oral sex behind Mario's back, and kills the former character with a gun.
 The  Super Smash Bros.  series makes Mario a much more serious character in comparison to his typical playful depiction, whereas his younger brother is made into somewhat of a "comical and childish, yet depressive" character. This is evident in Mario's actions, since all of his attacks are "straightforward and serious," while his brother looks unwilling, hesitant, or too drowsy to be on the offense. Mario also keeps a straight face or firm expression when battling, unlike Luigi. Mario's other facial expressions are not wild or gloomy like his brother's, since he will appropriately smile during his side taunt and victory poses; appear surprised or shocked when grabbed, pummeled, or launched; or appear angry when hanging on to ledges or attacking. However, Mario's personality does not change drastically, since he is still a person who values fairness. This is evident in his losing animation, where he claps for his opponent with a smile. In  The Subspace Emissary , Mario assumes a leadership role, since he makes it his job to unite the playable roster of  Brawl  to combat the evil  Tabuu  and the Subspace Army. Mario is friendly, since he is able to bond with most characters, including  Kirby  and  Pit , and is very happy to cooperate with them. However, one of Mario's aggressive tendencies arises, where he and Pit witness  Link  and  Yoshi  defeating the  False Peach  (thinking she is the real Peach), and Mario decides to fight them. In  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate , Mario is more whimsical and lighthearted during battle. One of his new taunts has him flash a thumbs-up.
 Mario seems to have a fixation with food. This is most notably seen in the DiC cartoon trilogy, which may also be the origin of this trait, where Mario is almost constantly hungry and fascinated with Italian food (mostly pizza and pasta), typically wanting to stop Bowser's latest scheme simply so he can eat and going to nearly any length to do so. In fact, in the  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  episode " Koopenstein ," when Princess Peach asked him if he ever thought about anything besides food, Mario, with pure honesty, replied, "What else is there?" As in  Super Mario 64  and its remake, the original reason Mario came to the castle is that Peach was baking him a  cake , which becomes a recurring trend in future games, such as  Super Mario Galaxy 2  and  New Super Mario Bros. Wii , although Mario, as well as his friends, has also fallen for false invitations to a big feast, shown in  Mario Party DS . Mario also dreams of pasta when he falls asleep in  Super Mario 64 , in  Super Mario Odyssey , and in the  Game Over  screen of  Mario vs. Donkey Kong . In the opening of  Super Mario Sunshine , Mario is apparently daydreaming about seafood. In  Fortune Street , he offers Yoshi to help by finding Yoshi's cookies but before playfully saying, "Just give me a second to brush these cookie crumbs out of my mustache!" Quite a few characters in other games also advised Mario to refrain from eating much. For instance, when Mario holds on to  Hoot  for too long, Hoot may complain about Mario's eating habits before getting exhausted and letting him go. Additionally, the  Star Gate  from  Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time , while praising Mario for his pure heart, has criticized his diet, advising him to limit the Alfredo sauce and carbonara in tandem with more exercising.
 
 Speech 
 Like many other protagonists of Nintendo games, Mario rarely speaks, his dialogue being primarily limited to numerous grunts and yells, making him a mostly semi-silent protagonist. When he does speak, he speaks English, sometimes broken, with a heavy Italian accent, often referring to himself in the third person. With Charles Martinet as his most recurring voice actor, Mario's voice is soft and high-pitched, but in a few other games and in the cartoons, Mario has a gruff voice usually associated with a Brooklyn accent. In the  Mario vs. Donkey Kong  titles, Mario speaks fully, shouting sentences such as "Come back here, you big monkey!" He can be clearly heard shouting, "Welcome! Welcome, new galaxy!" in the ending of  Super Mario Galaxy , as well as saying, "Thank you so much for playing my game!" after the credits of several games. Mario has also been given full dialogue in  Itadaki Street DS  and  Fortune Street . Despite Nintendo's emphasis on Mario as a silent protagonist, Mario is the most often heard speaking in full sentences, if occurrences outside the games (especially in special events in real life) are counted. In the  Super Smash Bros.  series , Mario is far less vocal than in the  Mario  games; specifically in  Super Smash Bros. Brawl  and  Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS  /  Wii U , Mario is portrayed with a more low-pitched voice.
 In some cases, Mario is a true silent protagonist, or he does not speak in English. In  Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars , Mario is completely silent, communicating solely through pantomime. In the  Paper Mario  titles, he mainly communicates through simple nodding and hand gestures; while he is completely silent in  Paper Mario , however, he is given grunts in the latter games. Mario is also silent during dialogue scenes in the  Mario Baseball  and  Mario & Sonic  series, although he can technically talk. In the  Mario & Luigi  titles, he and Luigi speak in unintelligible gibberish that the other characters can understand. In  Super Mario Sunshine , Mario is "heard" speaking in the opening scenes, but his dialogue is completely inaudible, although this is present only in the American version of the game, while in the Japanese version, Mario is heard speaking coherently, such as saying, "Looks like Mario's gonna have to find a job!" to Toadsworth after landing on the Delfino Airstrip, although he still speaks more than in most games in the series.
 He has full speech capabilities demonstrated in some sports titles and other games (including when being portrayed in real life), and he also speaks regularly in such mediums like the DiC cartoon trilogy, though he speaks perfect English with a Brooklyn accent in the latter. Mario has been shown to be able to speak in full sentences in promotional videos, such as a press conference released for  Mario Sports Mix . [32]  Also, people can communicate with Mario by asking various questions; there, too, Mario can fully speak, although his Italian accent mostly disappears. [28] [33] [34]  In the games, other characters speak for him, mainly Lakitu and Toad.

 Powers and abilities 
   Mario, usually in the spinoffs, such as  Super Smash Bros. , is associated with fire. 
 Mario's most notable ability is his  jump , which is his basic move he relies on to defeat enemies, avoid obstacles, and activate helpful items, such as  ? Blocks  and  P Switches . Although  Luigi  has superior jumping, Mario is more well-known. He is also capable of several acrobatic maneuvers, including the  Long Jump ,  backflip ,  Spin Jump , and  Wall Jump , with the Wall Jump being one of his most recurring abilities. Mario can also use a variety of basic martial arts attacks, including  punching  and  kicking , although he uses these moves the most in  Super Smash Bros.  games; in most games, jumping is his main form of attack. Mario's main weapon is the  hammer  in  Donkey Kong , although Mario often uses the hammer as a weapon in  Mario  RPGs.
 Mario is usually associated with fire in the spinoffs, based on his  Fire Mario  form from  Super Mario Bros.  Mario can, in some games, such as  Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars , control fire without a  Fire Flower  power-up, although the first game where he actually starts using this power regularly is  Super Smash Bros. Melee .
 
   Despite his small size, Mario can pick up even the heaviest of objects and foes, including Bowser. 
 Mario has been shown to possess superhuman strength. In  Super Mario World , he is seen lifting a fortress out of the ground and then kicking it away. In  Super Mario 64 , he can carry and throw the  Big Bob-omb , although with some difficulty. During the battles with Bowser, Mario can grab him by the tail, spin him, and throw him. His strength is also shown in  Super Mario Galaxy , where he can easily stun a  Mega Goomba  with a Star Spin despite its great size and can knock Bowser around during battles with him. In  Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story , although he is visibly straining, he is able to lift and throw an obese Luigi when using the  Snack Basket  move. In the spinoffs, Mario, although usually balanced, boasts generally slightly above-average power, and in golf, he has one of the strongest drives. He also has superhuman endurance, being capable of falling from high places such as a skyscraper without being hurt or just taking moderate damage, and a superhuman speed, being capable of keeping up with faster characters like Yoshi. He is also resistant to both heat and cold, as in some games, he can fall in lava without dying, and in  Super Mario Odyssey , he can fall in lava or similar substances or swim in icy water half-naked for around a minute and still explore the world while being partially frozen and without suffering from hypothermia. In this game, if he falls on lava, it burns his skin, and icy water partially freezes him, but those injuries disappear after a few seconds.
 Mario has been designed to be a versatile character deliberately. As a result, whenever he appears in a game, his emphasis is always, in both spinoffs and mainstream games, a balanced playstyle, allowing him to participate and perform well in many situations. Indeed, his bios have frequently and consistently described him as a "jack of all trades." Another result of his versatility is the number of occupations he holds, including his most notable and iconic identity of being a plumber. 
 
 
 Mario can also take advantage of several power-ups and transformations.
 
 Mario has fourteen power-ups that allow him to fly: the  Wing , the  Super Leaf , the  Tanooki Suit , the  P-Wing , the  Cape Feather , the  Power Balloon , the  Wing Cap , the  Power Flower , the  Bee Mushroom , the  Boo Mushroom , the  Red Star , the  Propeller Mushroom , the  Invincibility Leaf , and the  Super Acorn . On  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! , Mario can fly even after powering up with a  Fire Flower . 
 In  Super Mario Bros. 3 , Mario can transform into a  Hammer Brother  with the ability to throw hammers at his enemies or a  frog  with the ability to swim faster and jump higher. 
 Mario has three other caps he can wear: the  Metal Cap ,  Wing Cap , and  Vanish Cap . These turn him into  Metal Mario , make him fly, and make him invisible and intangible, respectively. 
 In  Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door , Mario becomes more paper-like and can become Flat Mario, Paper Tube Mario, Paper Airplane Mario, and Paper Boat Mario as a result of the "curses" cast upon him by the  Black Chest Demons . 
 In  Super Paper Mario , Mario was given the ability to  flip  between dimensions. 
 In  Super Mario World , Mario has the ability to run up walls and pipes. 
 In  Super Mario Odyssey , Mario can throw  Cappy  to " capture " sentient creatures and objects such as  Goombas ,  Chain Chomps ,  Hammer Bros ., and  Bullet Bills , allowing the player to fully control the captured target. 
 Occupations

 Mario is typically known as a plumber since  Mario Bros. , although he started as a carpenter in  Donkey Kong . Although he is best known for being a plumber, the games rarely portray Mario being directly involved in plumbing. Other media, such as  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! , however, put a much bigger emphasis on Mario's job. According to the live-action segments in  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! , Mario works a menial job at  Mario Brothers Plumbing  in  Brooklyn , just barely able to make enough money, and sometimes complains about a dull life. Despite this, he and Luigi seem to excel at their jobs, as it is stated that they have one of the best plumbing in  New York City . Also according to the show, Mario has received his plumber training from the  Brooklyn Plumbers Academy , founded by  Salvador Drainado , whom Mario holds to great respect. Mario is also skilled with various plumbing tools throughout the show's episodes, such as the  All Purpose Portable Plumber's Helper  and  Plumber's Putty , which he uses to assist him and his friends in some hazardous situations. In 2016, a bio on the Kids section of the Nintendo Co., Ltd. site indicates that plumbing was Mario's former occupation; the bio on  Mario Portal  reconfirmed this. [35]  However, as of March 2018, the Japanese profile was updated to state that Mario is still a plumber. [36] 
 In addition to plumbing, Mario has dabbled in various other occupations. One of his most notable recurring alternate careers is in medicine, as his alter-ego  Dr. Mario , who stars in  an entire spin-off series  and is even a separate character in the  Super Smash Bros.  games. Mario is also known for his participation in a wide variety of spin-off sports games, including but not limited to golf, tennis, basketball, hockey, soccer, and both kart and motocross racing. He also participates in a wide array of Olympic events and has even made a cameo as a referee in  Mike Tyson's Punch Out!!  Another subseries-specific recurring role Mario takes is as the president of the  Mario Toy Company  in the  Mario vs. Donkey Kong  games.
 In addition to these, he has also had numerous one-off jobs, again including but not limited to a demolition worker in  Wrecking Crew , an archaeologist in  Mario's Picross , a baker in  Yoshi's Cookie , a factory worker in  Mario's Cement Factory  and  Mario Bros.  for the Game & Watch, a soldier who delivers  bombs  in  Mario's Bombs Away , a  grocery  worker in  Super Mario Bros.: Peach-hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen! , a psychotherapist in  Super Mario Adventures  (albeit as a gag), and potentially a  sensei  in  Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars . Finally,  Super Mario Bros. & Friends: When I Grow Up  depicts Mario in various occupations, intending to educate children on several careers they can explore.
 
 Relationships 
 Family 
   LINE  sticker of Mario and Luigi giving each other a high five 
 Luigi is Mario's younger twin brother. Luigi often joins Mario on his adventures, and the two of them are normally paired together in sports titles and spin-offs. They have a strong brotherly bond ever since they were babies, and they stop at nothing to save each other when one is in trouble, as seen in games such as  Luigi's Mansion . In the  Mario & Luigi  series, if Luigi faints in battle, Mario yells in concern and carries him on his shoulders while defending himself or when running away (this also happens with Luigi if Mario gets KO'd) and the brothers often hug each other when they reunite after being separated in the story. Mario also is shown to be proud of his little brother when he faces his fears for him, such as when he faces  King Boo  to rescue him, and when he is saved in  Luigi's Mansion 3 , he is very happy that Luigi came to free him, and congratulates him before jumping in his arms and hugging him. It is stated in the 1993 official Nintendo Character Manual that Mario, when he retires, plans to give his plumbing business to Luigi (while also implying a distinct age contrast, which conflicts with the idea that they are twins). [31] 
 While they love each other, in  Paper Mario , Luigi admits that he also feels jealousy towards his brother at times and has also expressed that he is "tired of being Player 2," for despite being a hero in his own right, he is often overshadowed by Mario. While Mario states that Luigi's quote of being Player 2 is taken out of context, adding that "Luigi loves being [his] sidekick" in the  Mario Sports Mix  press conference, in  Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story , he is quick to give Luigi proper credit for defeating the Shroobs in the previous game. At times, Mario does exhibit a competitive sibling attitude toward Luigi, such as when he intentionally steps and squirms on Luigi's foot when Luigi receives a trophy in  Mario Power Tennis , which makes him uneasy and embarrassed. In volume 36 of  Super Mario-Kun , he also apparently ditches Luigi when Luigi is trapped in the  Star Gate , much to Luigi's dismay, only to return quickly to see Luigi break into tears. Overall, however, he acts as a good brother and role model for Luigi, notably shown in the  Mario & Luigi  series.
 
   Mario and Luigi's supposed parents 
 The rest of Mario's family has not been extensively explored, especially outside the games. Mario and Luigi's supposed parents make a cameo at the end of  Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island , although their faces are not seen and their names are not given, same as in their appearances in " Family Album "The Early Years" " and  Super Mario Issun-bÅshi . Furthermore,  Yoshi's New Island  has stated that these two are not Mario and Luigi's parents.  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! , on the other hand, mentioned or featured  Mama Mario  in a number of episodes, depicting her as a strict woman who loves her boys very much.  Their father  did not appear in the show, and very little is known about him.  The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  and the comics also make references or depict various other relatives of Mario, including aunts, uncles, and cousins, although none have appeared in any games.
 
 Friends and love interests 
 One of Mario's earliest friends is Yoshi, who, along with other Yoshis, saved him and Luigi from the Koopas when they were still babies. In  Yoshi's New Island , Mario has also reciprocated by traveling to the past to help Baby Mario and Yoshi save Baby Luigi. In the present day, Yoshi continues to help Mario against Bowser, usually serving as his steed. However,  Super Mario-Kun  depicted Mario in a more childish, aggressive manner, where he would yell at Yoshi for his mistakes, or even urinate on him as a punishment; this would often upset the latter. Overall, Mario and Yoshi get along well, and they always support each other through tough times. Another good friend of Mario's is Toad, who occasionally goes on adventures with him, as in  Super Mario Bros. 2 , various  Mario  cartoons, and the  Nintendo Comics System , where he is seen to be Mario's loyal and trusted sidekick. Toad trusts that Mario always saves the day and, even when not fighting alongside him, is quick to offer advice and encouragement.
 In  Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time , Mario has also shown to be a caring parental figure over Baby Mario, but he also steps in if any of his teammates misbehave. Mario appears to enjoy the babies' company. When Baby Mario finally returns to his own time period, he gives Mario his hammer as a parting gift, showing his pleasure to be with his adult self.
 
   Peach rewards Mario with a kiss after he wins a trophy in  Mario Power Tennis . 
 Mario saves Princess Peach quite often, and she usually rewards him with a kiss upon her rescue and often bakes him a  cake  as well. They share good chemistry in sports games and have been good friends since childhood. The German  Club Nintendo  comic " Warios WeihnachtsmÃ¤rchen " even reveals that they spent their graduation ball in school together, and in the official guide of  Yoshi's Island DS , the description for the level  Baby Mario and Baby Peach: Dynamic Duo  states they have teamed up as babies to stop evil before the "romantic entanglements" of their adult lives. While both Mario and Luigi deny a relationship when  Luvbi  asks if Peach was Mario's "lady friend," Luvbi also comments that the princess "looms large in his regard" and then wonders if Mario had a "one-sided crush." Many other sources, however, do portray Mario and Peach as having an ongoing romantic relationship, such as the official European  Mario  website listing Peach as Mario's girlfriend and  Mario Party 5  calling Peach and Mario's team "Cutest Couple." However, there have been rare occasions where Mario upset Peach, though unintentionally. In  Super Mario Odyssey , Mario is shown to be visibly distressed when Bowser attempts to propose to Princess Peach once more at the end of the game. Mario then proposes to Peach as well, with the two rivals closing in on the monarch. Peach refuses the red plumber and the Koopa King, leaving both distraught. However, immediately afterward, she invites them both to go back home to the Mushroom Kingdom, and it is strongly implied after the game's ending that she forgives him for the events on the Moon.
 Peach has not been Mario's only romantic interest, however. In the original  Donkey Kong ,  Pauline  was Mario's first girlfriend and damsel-in-distress, but while he still has to occasionally rescue her in the  Mario vs. Donkey Kong  series, the two are considered just friends now. In addition, when Mario saved Princess Daisy in her debut appearance in  Super Mario Land , a heart appeared overhead, implying a romantic connection. This was never explored further, however, and while  Mario Party 4  gave them the team name "Nice Couple," most games link Daisy with Luigi instead, with her and Mario simply being friends, not even sharing any player chemistry in the  Mario Baseball  series.
 Throughout his adventure, Mario has also befriended numerous characters, notably his partners in the  Paper Mario  series. His partners are loyal to him, and some, such as  Vivian , even have developed somewhat of a crush on him, whereas  Ms. Mowz  often flirts with him. Several other characters, especially in the  Mario  RPGs, including  Toadette , are also wooed by Mario's heroic antics, although Mario himself has shown little interest. Mario has also made friends with characters outside the  Mario  series. For instance, he teamed up with  Kirby ,  Link , and even  Mega Man  in the German  Club Nintendo  comics.  Pit  in  Super Smash Bros. for Wii U  even happily recalls his past adventure with Mario back in  Super Smash Bros. Brawl  and shows admiration for him and wants his autograph. Mario is also shown to be protective of his newfound friends; in  Paper Mario: The Origami King , he is horrified when  Bob-omb  prepares to self-destruct to smash a boulder and is saddened by his resulting death, although not as bad as Olivia, who is unable to go on until he cheers her up and reminds her to not make his sacrifice in vain. Also, in the ending of  Super Mario Sunshine , Mario is visibly upset by the loss of  F.L.U.D.D.  when it shuts down, as he trembles and wipes away a tear.
 Mario has also befriended and teamed up with  variants   of   himself , showing kinship and/or synergy with them.
 
 
 Foes and rivals 
   Mario and his many friends and foes 
 Bowser is Mario's arch-nemesis, and the two are locked in a never-ending cycle of conflict. Bowser constantly tries to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and/or kidnap Peach. Each time Bowser upsets the peace, Mario stops at nothing to defeat him and set things right. Bowser often calls Mario a variety of disparaging nicknames, especially in the cartoons. Mario sometimes returns the insults, but such retorts are usually restricted to the cartoons and other non-game media, since Mario is portrayed as silent if not more cheerful and polite. When Mario does lose to Bowser, he acknowledges it in good nature, such as in  Fortune Street , although he expects himself to be a competent adversary for Bowser. Occasionally the two team up to defeat greater evils, such as in  Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars ,  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga , and  Super Paper Mario , and while Bowser openly hates Mario and resents him for his close relationship with Peach, for his part, Mario has never truly shown hatred or contempt against Bowser, and he is often more than happy to forgive Bowser after he defeats him, such as in  Mario Party DS , where they enjoy playing  Triangle Twisters  together.
 Bowser is not Mario's only foe, however, and in the original  Donkey Kong , it was  Donkey Kong  (later known as  Cranky Kong ) that Mario had to defeat. The current Donkey Kong and Mario are on much better terms and often participate in sports and spin-offs together. Although they do maintain a friendly and somewhat competitive rivalry, Mario must defeat Donkey Kong a couple times in the  Mario vs. Donkey Kong  series because Donkey Kong went into mischief, stemming from his passion and frustration for Mini Marios and Pauline. Even after his victory, after noticing Donkey Kong upset, Mario reconciles by offering his toys.
 Mario's archrival is Wario, with various comics depicting their antagonistic relationship starting in childhood, and it is a major theme in the  Super Mario-Kun  manga. In Wario's first appearance, in  Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins , he stole  Mario's castle , and in  Mario Super Sluggers , he tried to destroy Mario, although for the most part, their rivalry is far more mild in nature, and the two even team up to defeat Bowser in  Super Mario 64 DS . Finally, according to Wario in  Wario's Warehouse , both Wario and Waluigi hang out with him, although Mario frequently peeks at Wario's Warehouse. Wario has shown mostly contempt for Mario, but he does not have the same level of dislike as Bowser, whereas Mario, although he has been initially bitter and even called Wario an "evil creep," [37]  maintains his cheerful and positive attitude as he does with most of his enemies.
 Mario appears to be friendly rivals with  Sonic the Hedgehog , as the two have teamed up several times to stop Bowser and  Dr. Eggman . They appear to be extremely competitive in sports and events. According to an informal conversation with Mario, Mario  stated in response  that he likes Sonic and views him as a friendly archrival than an enemy.

 Profiles and statistics 
 Main article:  List of Mario profiles and statistics 
   An example of Mario's balanced characteristics 
 Mario has consistently and frequently appeared in every game as a balanced player designed to be mastered easily. The only notable exceptions are the  Mario Golf  games, where he has a high drive, higher than most of the cast, including known-power characters such as Wario and Donkey Kong (in  Mario Golf: World Tour , for instance, his drive is surpassed only by Bowser, Rosalina, and Donkey Kong). Otherwise, since Mario is designed as a versatile character, his stats reflect the "jack of all trades" quality. In games where Mario's stats are not equally balanced, he generally leans slightly toward power. While Mario is fairly nimble in games such as  Super Smash Bros. ,  Mario Super Sluggers , the  Mario & Luigi  series, and the  Mario & Sonic  series, he is sometimes portrayed with average or even below-average mobility in other games, including  Mario Superstar Baseball ,  Mario Tennis  games, and  Mario Strikers Charged .
 Most bios have described Mario as a well-known icon in the Mushroom Kingdom, in Nintendo, and in video gaming in general. They may also celebrate his numerous accomplishments or his previous forays.
 Mario's most frequent associated color scheme has been red, although his scheme may sport blue or white motifs. His logo is his trademark  M cap .

 Trivia 
 According to a 1993 Nintendo character guide, Mario is classified as " Homo nintendonus ." [41] 
 According to the Insiders' Calendar included in the second issue of  Nintendo Power , Mario's birthday is October 11. [42] [43] 
 There is a nuclear bunker in Nebraska, called Foxtrot-01, that has murals of Mario,  Wario ,  Bowser , and  Princess Peach . [44] 
 There was some controversy to Mario and the NES version of  Super Mario Bros. . Mario in particular was noted as having a slight physical similarity to the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin as well as replacing the Koopa flag with a flag that resembled the Soviet Red Star.  Nintendo Power  addressed this issue by putting Mario's moustache on Ivan Drago from  Rocky IV  and denied that there was any intentional resemblance  [ citation needed ] .

Excerpt:  ""You might say I'm still waiting for my royalty checks," Segale told The Seattle Times in 1993. He didn't confirm widely circulated stories that "Super Mario" got his name after Segale stormed into Nintendo's office, angrily demanding overdue rent. But many business associates say those tales fit the Mario they know â a hard-driving businessman who can be warm and generous, but also can display a temper when he doesn't get what he wants. .

The intruder goes by the name of Wario. He has been jealous of my popularity ever since we were boys, and has tried to steal my castle many times. It seems he has succeeded this time. Wario has scattered the 6 Golden Coins from my castle all over Mario Land. These Golden Coins are guarded by those under Wario's spell. Without these coins, we can't get into the castle to deal with Wario. We must collect the six coins, attack Wario in the castle, and save everybody! "
