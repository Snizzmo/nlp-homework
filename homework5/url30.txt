 Mar 10  Fun Holiday – Mario Day March 10 is Mario Day, a day to celebrate the main character of the popular Nintendo video game franchise, Super Mario. Mario falls when he skids on a banana peel. Â©iStockphoto.com/jeff5150 
 March 10 was chosen by fans of the game as the date for this holiday because March 10 when abbreviated and written without a space between the month and date â Mar10 â looks like the word Mario. 
 Fictional Italian Plumber 
 The Super Mario video games follows the adventures of Italian plumber Mario and his brother Luigi while they try to rescue Princess Peach from the evil Bowser. Princess Peach is the princess of the fictional Mushroom Kingdom in which the game is set. 
 Best-Selling Game

Since his first appearance in the 1981 Nintendo game, Donkey Kong as Jumpman, Mario has featured in over 200 video games, and several television shows and comics. 
 How to Celebrate? 
 
 Spend the day playing the iconic game. 
 Have a super Mario themed party. Serve star shaped cookies , mushroom shaped cupcakes, and chocolate coins. 
 And if you are brave enough, why not dress up like Mario for the day? 
 
 Did You Knowâ¦ 
 â¦that when Mario made his first gaming appearance as Jumpman, he was not a plumber but a carpenter?
